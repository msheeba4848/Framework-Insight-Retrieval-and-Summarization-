Irwin, a United States Commissioner acting as justice of the peace at Douglas, Alaska, together with the undertaking on appeal accepted by him, have been duly filed by the clerk of this court. The district attorney moves to dismiss-the appeal on the following grounds: (i) The notice of appeal' does not sufficiently describe the judgment appealed from; (2) no undertaking has been filed by the defendant in this case, as required by section 442, c. 43, of the Alaska <a id="p677" href="#p677" data-label="677" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*677</a>Criminal Code (Act March 3, 1899, c. 429, <a href="/citations/?q=30%20Stat.%201334" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="30 Stat. 1334">30 Stat. 1334</a>); (3) no undertaking has been filed by the defendant in this case, as required by section 446, c. 43, of the Alaska Criminal Code.</p>

There is no question or dispute that an undertaking was filed and sent up with the papers in the case. Section 451 of the Code provides as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="AyI" data-blocks='[["BL_701.5",701,[151,894,1139,215]]]'>“An appeal cannot be dismissed, on motion of tbe appellee on ae-count of tbe undertaking tberefor being defective, if tbe appellant, before tbe determination of tbe motion to dismiss will execute a sufficient undertaking and file tbe same in tbe appellate court, upon sucb terms as may be deemed just.”</blockquote>

Rapalje defines “defect” as “deficiency; insufficiency; the absence of something required by law.” Webster defines it as “wanting in something; incomplete; lacking a part; deficient; imperfect; faulty.” When the law speaks of a defective undertaking, it necessarily means that.there is an undertaking; that there is something in which there is a defect’; something wanting; something incomplete, deficient, imperfect. Can it be possible that the statute means that, where the attempt has been made to file an undertaking for appeal, it means anything— any kind of writing, though it lack all the essentials of an undertaking? I cannot so construe the language of our statute. It seems to me that a defective undertaking means one which contains most of the essentials of the statute, but lacks something not very material, and going to matters of form, and not of substance. If the pretended undertaking in this case is so defective in substance as to be void, then it would seem .that such a paper would be no undertaking at all, and that any appeal undertaken with such a paper as its foundation must be treated as if no attempt whatever had been made to <a id="p678" href="#p678" data-label="678" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*678</a>file the undertaking required by statute. If the paper filed is defective in form merely, and is voidable, but not void, it would seem that such, a paper would come within the purview of the statute as defective, and that an appeal should not be dismissed on account of such defect, if the appellant, before the determination of the motion to dismiss, should execute a sufficient undertaking and file the same in the appellate court.</p>
    <p id="b702-4" data-blocks='[["BL_702.4",702,[329,825,1146,255]]]'>In the determination of this motion, therefore, we are to consider it upon the theory that the paper filed is either void or voidable only. Surely it is very imperfect, and must come-under one of these' heads. L,et us examine the original páper, called an “undertaking” or “cost bond.” It reads as follows r</p>

It is recited that some judgment was rendered in the Commissioner’s Court of Douglas Island, Alaska; but what judgment? Was it a judgment of imprisonment? Was-it a fine? What is there in this paper to indicate from what' this party was appealing? Nor is there anything in this paper to. show to what court the appeal is addressed or is to be' taken. The statute requires that this bond shall be given within 30 days from the date of judgment. When there is nothing in the bond by which the judgment could possibly' be identified, not even the date of the judgment, how could-any one examining this paper determine whether it was given' <a id="p679" href="#p679" data-label="679" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*679</a>within the time required by law? If it is not given within the time limited, then no appeal can be taken. This obligation required by law, and called an “undertaking for appeal,” is, in a sense, jurisdictional. No appeal can be granted without it, and the undertaking must be accepted by the magistrate before he can allow such appeal.</p>

Being void, it does not come within the purview of the statute that an appeal cannot be dismissed on motion of the appellee on .account of the undertaking therefor being defective, if the appellant, before the determination of the motion to dismiss, will execute a sufficient undertaking, and file the same in the appellate court, upon such terms as may be deemed just.</p>
