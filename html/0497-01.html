The course of the vessel was changed, she wms backed to relieve her from the strain, and a good place was sought to beach the barges. Just opposite a sandy cove on the north shore, with the wind on shore at the rate of 30 miles an hour, they anchored the front barge and cut the side barges loose, with the design of saving them and their caroges by beaching them in the cove. .Their design failed in one feature only — the front barge swamped at her <a id="p505" href="#p505" data-label="505" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*505</a>moorings about 300 or 400 feet off shore. 'The other two safely beached, as expected, in the sandy cove. The Louise, though in great peril, turned back and reached St. Michael Harbor, but in such an unmanageable condition that she went ashore there. Her crew and passengers were rescued with danger. The evidence shows that the Louise left St. Michael at midnight, and returned to the'harbor- and was beached about 4 o’clock in the morning. The barges were cut loose about 2:3o a. m., about a mile or a mile and a half off shore. The wind was blowing at the rate of 30 miles an hour on shore.</p>

In company with one McSherry, he interviewed one Lascelles, a fireman who came ashore from the Louise, and testifies that Lascelles told them the barges had been cut loose some nine miles north of the coast. Well knowing that the barges would come ashore before such a wind, he testifies that “finally we made up our minds that it would be a •pretty good thing for us to strike out on our own hook on a little salvage expedition.” So accurate was the information obtained by them from Lascelles that they went speedily and directly to the spot where the barges had been beached by the master. It was eight miles distant along the beach, and upon the journey Spaulding and McKinney met, and thereafter continued and acted together. They testify that they saw the barges when yet distant from their final landing place a mile, and that they were all three coming rapidly ashore before the wind. This, they say, was about 7 o’clock in the morning. They also testify that two of the barges reached a point only 150 feet from shore by the time they arrived there, and that the third suddenly swamped about 300 or 400 <a id="p506" href="#p506" data-label="506" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*506</a>feet from shore. They testify that they boarded the two’ stranded barges, got an anchor ashore, and a line fast to the anchor, and then, hauling in on the slack of the line, they drew the barges further upon the land, and thus preserved them. It is admitted that the wind continued to blow heavily on shore for two days, and the evidence is clear that there was no contrary and dangerous current and no danger of rocks.</p>
    <p id="b530-4" data-blocks='[["BL_530.4",530,[316,803,1152,1059]]]'>A short distance away from where the barges beached stood an Eskimo village, and some of these people, being introduced on behalf of the respondent, testified that the barges came ashore just at sunrise, which would be very early at that season. This evidence agrees with that of the officers of the Eouise. The Eskimo witnesses say that they saw the steamer and saw the barges cut loose, and that it was not long before the barges struck the beach solidly; that it was much later when the white men (the libelants) came, and that, when the white men arrived, the tide was falling, the strong wind having, as usual, carried the water out of Norton Sound and St. Michael Bay; before the white men (libelants) reached the barges, an Eskimo had gone on the barges to unfasten a dog, and had succeeded. They testified that they gathered from the surf much of the cargo coming ashore from the sunken barge, but deny that libelants did. They further testify that libelants did not reach the barges until 9 or io-o’clock in the morning, and got out no anchor until the tide went out, leaving the barges fiat on the beach, and making it easy to roll the anchor ashore.</p>

The libelants had nothing to do with beaching the barges in this sandy cove. That was designed and carried out by the officers of the respondent on board the Louise, and was the primary, if not the only, means of saving them. The on-shore gale blew the barges upon the sands and held them there. No evidence is offered to show that they could or would have moved a foot up or down the beach. The court is satisfied that no act done by libelants assisted in any" way in holding the barges on shore; it was impossible to move them off in opposition to the on-shore wind. The anchors put out by the libelants, whether put out in the morning or evening, gave no aid in rescuing the property from peril, for the winds never abated their strength on shore, nor was it shown that, even if the course of the wind had changed, and come from the opposite direction, the barges could have lifted after once reaching their place on the crest of the high on-shore waves. Success in saving these barges and their loads was due entirely to the design of the; officers on board the Louise beaching them at a safe place. True it is that the libelants, in pursuance of the information given them by the fireman of the Louise in St. Michael, were enabled to race across the tundra and reach these barges ahead of the employés of the respondent; but they rendered no meritorious services in saving either the barges or cargo. They knew that the officers of the Louise had cut them loose,, and that they would find them on shore, as they did. Their action in racing there and boldly taking possession of them was, as McKinney well said, a “little salvage expedition” — a predatory excursion without a single just or equitable feature of salvage service to excuse it. Their service brought no sue-<a id="p508" href="#p508" data-label="508" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*508</a>■cess in saving the property. It was not a meritorious service nor beneficial in any respect. It resembles, more than anything else, the action of the master of the- Timandra in placing a man on board the bark Cleone for the purpose of dividing another man’s property because he rescued it first in the race.</p>
    <blockquote id="b532-4" data-blocks='[["BL_532.4",532,[336,723,1145,402]]]'>“Useful services of any kind rendered to a vessel or her cargo, exposed to any impending danger and imminent peril of loss or damage, may entitle those who render such services to salvage reward. •* * <em>* </em>Compensation as salvage is not viewed hy the admiralty •courts merely as pay, on the principle of a quantum meruit, or as a remuneration pro opere et lahore, hut as a reward given for perilous -services, voluntarily rendered, and as an inducement to seamen and others to embark in such undertaking to save life and property.” The Blackwell, 77 U.

    <p id="b532-5" data-blocks='[["BL_532.5",532,[328,1154,1154,1060]]]'>Public policy suggests that courts ought to be fair, and ■even liberal, in compensating salvors who have thus saved derelict property, but no such liberality can be shown unless it affirmatively appears that their services were an aid to the enterprise. Beach-combing, predatory excursions to fasten vipon another man’s property before he can reach it, mere possession, without aid in saving it from peril — these are not services for which admiralty courts will award salvage compensation. Whatever may be said of the labor performed by the libelants in going to the place of wreck, their efforts to get anchors and lines ashore, and their alleged salvage of wreckage from the sunken barge, it is my judgment that it falls far short of invoking the equitable principle of admiralty law which can justify this court in decreeing them an award .as a compensation for such services. The efforts of the officers on board the T'ouise, and the prevailing winds of which they took advantage, are entitled to all the credit for saving -what was saved from their tow, and nothing can be awarded to the libelants for their intrusion when their services were not needed. Tet a decree be entered against the libelants.</p>
