S. Comp. St. 1901, pp. 1429, 1430], for a patent to the Simpson placer mine, located over a portion of the main town of Nome, and in the Cape Nome mining district. Within the time limited by law the plaintiff filed an adverse claim in the land office, and began this suit in ejectment to recover a portion of the ground, alleging it to be a part of <a id="p579" href="#p579" data-label="579" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*579</a>tbe Utah and Winchester placer mines, theretofore located by its grantors. Thereafter, and on March 7, 1902, Lindbloom filed a complaint in intervention, alleging his ownership of certain town lots within the disputed area; his waiver of his adverse claim in the land office in consideration of an agreement by Simpson to sell them to him when patent should be issued to him; and an allegation of connivance and fraud between plaintiff and defendant, whereby defendant, after the expiration of Ifindbloom’s time for filing an adverse claim had expired, agreed to abandon the land, and permit plaintiff to acquire title.

St. 1878.

Upon the one hand it is urged that the proceeding or suit which the adverse claimant must begin in a court of competent jurisdiction in support of his claim is only that ordinary action which he could bring under the local law without regard to the patent proceeding, to determine the question of the right of possession to the claim; that the suit is independent of the land office proceeding both as to parties and. subject-matter, and is to be governed as to parties, pleadings,- and practice only by the local law; that the land office proceedings are immaterial, and need not be referred to in the <a id="p581" href="#p581" data-label="581" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*581</a>pleadings; and that, whether it is a suit to quiet title or in ejectment, the pleadings need only contain those allegations required by the local law, and that proper and necessary parties plaintiff and defendant or in intervention, under the local law, are not barred by sections 2325 and 2326 and the amend-atory act of 1881 (Act March 3, 1881, c. 140, <a href="/citations/?q=21%20Stat.%20505" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="21 Stat. 505">21 Stat. 505</a> [U.

To put it in the exact words of counsel for the defendant, the “court becomes, under the special proceeding authorized by sections 2325 and 2326 of the Revised Statutes of the United States, an auxiliary of the executive department to try conflicts in mining claims, and to report the results for the guidance of the executive department in the disposal of its public lands.” Very much of all this may be admitted, but the real point in question is this: Does the power of the “court of competent jurisdiction to determine the question of the right -of possession,” mentioned in section 2326, flow in any degree from that act? Does the act either confer any power or jurisdiction upon the court, or in any wise limit its power or jurisdiction, under the law of its creation, either as to parties or the subject-matter of the action? The answer to this inquiry is decisive of the matter before the court for this reason, viz., if this court is authorized to try the case solely under the provisions of the Alaska Code, the interveners may properly come in as parties; but, if the power or jurisdiction of the court is limited by the acts of Congress to a controversy between the applicant and adverse claimant in the land office proceeding, then the intervention cannot be allowed, for the town has not filed an adverse claim in the land office. It will be noticed that the statute only requires the suit to be brought in a court <a id="p582" href="#p582" data-label="582" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*582</a>of competent jurisdiction (and the Supreme Court of the United States has declared that this means either a local territorial or state court), or when, under the general rules, a federal question is involved, in a federal court. Neither does the statute contain a direct limitation as to parties, for it carefully states that the adverse claimant shall commence proceedings to determine the question of the right of possession, not his right of possession. The whole question of the right, of possession is thus brought before the trial court, without limitation, and since the amendatory act of 1881 neither the applicant nor the adverse claimant can secure a patent unless one or the other establishes affirmatively his exclusive right to the possession and patent against the government and all persons interested.

That was a suit to determine the rights of the applicant and adverse claimant to a mining claim in the territory of Dakota and which was carried to the Supreme Court of the United States. During the trial below it appeared that one Mahan, not a party of record, asserted an interest in the claim, and was a necessary party lo a complete determination of the matter in controversy. He had not filed an adverse claim in the land office. He was made a party defendant notwithstanding that fact, and the judgment was affirmed. The court determined that the Dakota provision in relation to the amendment of pleadings by adding to or striking out the name of any party, or by correcting a mistake in the name of any party, applied to the ■case, and sustained the decision of the court in permitting Mahan to be a party to the case. It follows that, if he could <a id="p589" href="#p589" data-label="589" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*589</a>be made a partjr by a motion without his consent, he might hav&lt;* become a party by intervention. It seems to me that this case settles the very point at issue, and permits an intervention by one who has not filed an adverse claim. I conclude, from an examination of the authorities, that this suit, while it is a step required by the act of Congress in aid of the land office proceeding, is supported by the jurisdiction which this court possesses by virtue of the Code of Alaska, both as to párties and subject-matter. It is a suit in ejectment, and the pleadings should contain only those jurisdictional allegations' required by chapter 32 of the Code of Civil Procedure in relation to actions to recover the possession of real property. Section 303 of that chapter authoritatively states what such a complaint shall contain. It should contain nothing more, and need contain no reference to the land office proceedings. It may be true that neither of the interveners' in this case can'procure a patent by virtue of their appearance in this case, because they have not filed an adverse claim in the land office. But they clearly have the right to contest the claims of the applicant and adverse claimant to siich patent, and, if the interveners are the real owners of this property, and the'court shall so determine by its judgment, the result wall be that neither the applicant nor adverse claimant will' receive a patent, whereby the rights of the interveners will be fully protected.</p>

In Colo<a id="p590" href="#p590" data-label="590" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*590</a>rado, where that theory is followed by the state courts, the Supreme Court in the case of Seymour v. Fisher, <a href="/citations/?q=27%20P.%20240" class="citation" data-index="82" data-cite="27 P. 240">27 Pac. 240</a>, says:</p>
    <blockquote id="b614-4" data-blocks='[["BL_614.4",614,[349,570,1145,395]]]'>“But if, by reason of the fraudulent conduct of the patentee, the •would-be eontestor is kept in ignorance of the pendency of patent proceedings, and is thus prevented from availing himself of the statutory remedy, a court of equity may, in our judgment, interfere. * * * And when the foundation is laid by proof showing clearly the fraud of the applicant, whereby the complaining party has been kept in ignorance of the existence of the patent proceedings, the court may consider the right of such party to the ground in controversy.”</blockquote>
    <p id="b614-5" data-blocks='[["BL_614.5",614,[345,988,1146,686]]]'>In my judgment, the notice of the application for patent in the land office proceeding in this case is fatally defective, and cannot be made to support a patent in opposition to the rights of other claimants, who had no other notice. However, I accept the view expressed by the Supreme Court of California in the case of Quigley v. Gillett, <a href="/cal/101/0462-01" class="citation" data-index="83" data-cite="101 Cal. 462" data-case-ids="1922868" data-case-paths="/cal/101/0462-01">101 Cal. 462</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=35%20P.%201041" class="citation" data-index="84" data-cite="35 P. 1041">35 Pac. 1041</a>, that this court “has nothing to do with the proceedings in the land office, and no power to determine as to their regularity or irregularity, sufficiency or insufficiency.” This court stands upon its own jurisdiction, and not that acquired by the notice in the initiation of the land office proceedings ; otherwise the interventions would be denied, and the case dismissed, for want of jurisdiction.</p>
    <p id="b614-6" data-blocks='[["BL_614.6",614,[343,1687,1144,524]],["BL_615.1",615,[89,403,1147,783]]]'>The right of an intervener claiming ownership and possession against both the applicant and adverse claimant under the patent proceedings to appear in this action and contest their claims is further strengthened by the last clause of section 2325: “And thereafter no objection from third parties to the issuance of a patent shall be heard, except it be shown that the applicant has failed to comply with the terms of this chapter.” Third parties, then, may appear as protestants to show that the applicant has failed to comply with the terms of the law, and is not entitled to a patent. The <a id="p591" href="#p591" data-label="591" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*591</a>statute, however, does not limit the appearance of these third parties to the Land Department. They may appear at any stage of the proceedings to show the failure of the applicant to comply with the law. A protestant in the land office proceeding is an intervener who appears by virtue of the statute to show that the applicant has failed to comply with the law; and intervener in this action is a protestant, who appears by virtue of the same statute to show that the applicant has failed to comply with the law. Neither can acquire the status or right of an adverse claimant by such appearance, but either may defend his rights by showing the failure of the applicant or claimant to comply with the law. It is my opinion that the intervention of such third parties for such purposes is allowed and justified by the provisions of the language quoted from the statute.</p>
    <p id="b615-4" data-blocks='[["BL_615.4",615,[91,1208,1143,361]]]'>Upon an examination of the complaints in intervention, I am satisfied that both Lindbloom and the town of Nome have an interest in the matter of litigation against both the applicant and adverse claimant in the land office, and are proper parties to intervene. The objections to the intervention of the town of Nome are overruled, and leave is given to file its complaint.</p>
