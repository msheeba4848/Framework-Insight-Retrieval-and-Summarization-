The court below must have exceeded its jurisdiction. If it had jurisdiction, but decided wrongly, certiorari will not lie. People v.

If, then, there was right of appeal at the time the writ of review issued in this case, the writ of review was wrongfully and imprudently issued, and, being so issued, gave this court no jurisdiction of the case at bar. Clearly, the right of appeal from the decisions of the justice’s court was abundantly provided for by the statutes of Oregon in force in 1884. If those statutes were in force in Alaska, and can be so held, this court is without jurisdiction to hear and determine cases where the amount involved exceeds $200.</p>

Wherever counties; or other like legal subdivisions, are mentioned in the general laws of Oregon in force in 1884, it is clear that such acts or parts of acts would have no application to counties in Alaska, because no such subdivisions as counties have been established here. They do not exist. There are many other like provisions in the general laws of Oregon that, in the nature of things, are inapplicable to conditions in Alaska, because of the failure of law to create conditions whereby they might be made applicable. Does the word “applicable” apply to natural conditions of the country, or to its topographical conditions ? Shall we say that laws are not applicable to the conditions of this country because it is mountainous, or because of the inclemency of the weather, or because of the great distance between different points and different settlements of people? Daws are enacted for the control of the affairs of men, to protect the rights of property, to protect life and liberty, and to punish those who thrive by preying upon society. If settlements are at great distances from seats of justice, where alone relief for wrongs may be obtained, and the time is fixed by the statutes of Oregon for the performance of certain conditions, by which alone the right of the people may be enforced, it might be said that so much of the general laws of Oregon as requires the performance of conditions within an impossible period would not be held to be in force; but that, in lieu of the impossible period fixed by statute, the courts would properly- and fairly hold that a <a id="p178" href="#p178" data-label="178" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*178</a>reasonable time should be given for the performance of such conditions. If, therefore, under the statutes of Oregon, appeals from justice courts are required by law to be taken in such short space of time that the right of appeal would in some instances be cut off, the law controlling appeals would not, for that reason, fail; and we cannot say that, because of that, there is no appeal, but rather when, in the matter of time, an impossibility is required, may we not more properly say that the performance of the required condition, whatever it may be, within a reasonable time, is all that the court can demand? The lawmakers of Oregon, in fixing the short period of time, giving 30 days for appeal from justice court, and requiring the transcript to be filed in the higher court before the beginning of the next term of the circuit court, doubtless intended to give a reasonable time within which such acts might be performed. Following the same theory of “reasonable time,” the law of appeal might be enforced in Alaska, giving such reasonable time for filing the transcript in the District Court as the situation of the parties might make necessary.</p>
    <p id="b202-4" data-blocks='[["BL_202.4",202,[366,1502,1143,310]]]'>It seems that such a construction of the law of Oregon is absolutely necessary to our conditions. To hold the law not in force because of inapplicable parts of the statute would be to discard in the main the great body of the laws of that state, and to leave us practically without laws for our guidance.</p>
    <p id="b202-5" data-blocks='[["BL_202.5",202,[363,1823,1147,412]]]'>But have we a remedy in certiorari ? Under the decisions of the Supreme Court of Oregon it was at one time held that the writ of certiorari might issue when the term fixed by statute within which appeals should be taken had passed. The later decision of that court holds that the same term •controls both remedies, except that a later statute, not in force in this territory, provides that the writ shall issue within a fixed period.</p>
    <p id="b203-3" data-blocks='[["BL_203.3",203,[318,436,1150,1324]]]'>
      <a id="p179" href="#p179" data-label="179" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*179</a>If the law fixing a time within which appeals shall be taken and the transcript filed in the higher court is not in force, is that law in force which gives the right to the writ of certiorari or review, where practically the same period of time is fixed for the issuance of the writ? The statute controlling both remedies as to time should have a reasonable construction, and a reasonable time should be allowed to be given under the law, both for taking an appeal and for the issue of the writ. It is difficult to see where the sparsely settled condition of the territory, and the great distances that separate some communities from the place of holding the District Court, will work greater hardship in one remedy {that of appeals) than in the other (by certiorari). If, then, we hold the remedy by appeals as well as by certiorari to be in force, and the remedies not concurrent — and they are not, unless made so by statute — we find ourselves in the situation of allowing a proceeding of certiorari when there is another adequate legal remedy — a conclusion contrary to the universal holdings of all courts, so far as we know, not committed by statute to a contrary view. But in the case at bar now particularly under consideration, the amount involved being less than $200, the right of appeal does not exist. We are, then, presented with this proposition: Is there no relief from decisions of the lower courts where the amount in controversy is less than $200 ?</p>
    <p id="b203-4" data-blocks='[["BL_203.4",203,[323,1773,1144,250]]]'>It is the opinion of the court that, where an attempt has been made to obtain relief by writ of review within a reasonable time, the case is properly before this court, and relief may be granted where the amount involved is less than $200.</p>
