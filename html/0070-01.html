Johnson, United States District Attorney, on the 29th day of April, 1892, in said court, against said steam schooner Challenge, her boats, tackle, apparel, furniture, cargo, engines, and fixtures, in which it is alleged that said vessel, her captain, officers, and crew, on the 17th day of November, 1891, were engaged in killing, and did kill, within the limits of Alaskan territory, to wit, on St. George Island, in Bering Sea, a large number of fur seals, viz., 37, in violation of section 1956 of the Revised Statutes of the United States and acts of Congress and the proclamation of the President thereunder.</p>

On the day set for hearing no appearance was mad'e on behalf of said vessel, or any person as claimant, no answer or pleading of any kind being filed. The libelants appeared by said United States attorney.

Some of them, however, were lost, and from the evidence it appears that only 37 skins were secured on board of the vessel, and those were seized with it, and are now in the hands of the United States marshal of this district.</p>
