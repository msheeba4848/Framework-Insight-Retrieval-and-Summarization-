It is alleged that, by following the vein or lode on the dip thereof, the plaintiff has passed beyond the side line of its lode mining claim and beyond the shore line of Gastineau channel, which said channel is an arm of the sea, and is now working under said arm of the sea, the greatest working depth attained being about 900 feet; that the defendants, in sinking their shaft and discharging blasts in that behalf, cause the ground beneath to vibrate and the waters of the sea to flow through fissures in the rock that forms the roof above the workings of the plaintiff, thereby causing large quantities of the water of the sea to flow in upon the plaintiff, to its great and irreparable injury; and that, unless the defendants are restrained from further pursuing the work of sinking their said shaft, the plaintiff’s mine will become flooded and made valueless. The defendants deny these matters generally, but admit they are engaged in sinking a shaft, etc.; allege it to be on a lode mining claim properly located by them, and that their work in no wise damages plaintiff.

It further appears that the defendants have sunk shafts a few feet in depth, the surface at the point of sinking being above mean high tide, and have exposed rock in place of some value, the quartz taken therefrom showing good value; that shafts have been sunk at one or more places, the defendants claiming a lawful location of a lode mining claim, and that they are entitled to work the same even though some injury should result therefrom to the plaintiff. It is admitted that the particular shaft complained of is on what defendants claim to be the strike of their vein, and that the surface where said shaft was begun is below mean high tide. It further appears from the evidence, the admitted facts, and the personal observation of the court when present upon the ground, on invitation of the parties to this action, that only a few feet of the vein claimed by defendants extends, at either end thereof, above mean high tide, and that, following the strike of the vein or lode a few feet from the point of discovery, the vein passed below the tide line, and that the apex of the vein, except at low tide, other than these few feet, is beneath the sea, and a considerable portion is below even low tide.</p>

Considering the language of the section, it might possibly include any of the mineral lands of the United States; but, under the policy of our government, the tide lands have never been sold by the general government. The original states, upon the formation of the Union, held the tide lands subject to their several control. In order that new states, carved out of the various portions of the public domain, should, when admitted as states of the Union, be admitted on an equality with all the other states, it has been deemed wise ■ — and perhaps obligatory upon the general government — to so hold these tide lands that, when the new states should be formed, they should be transferred to the sole control of such states, to be disposed of as might seem wise to them. Considering this policy of the government in dealing with this class of lands, it would seem that the legislation by Congress relative to the disposition of its agricultural and mineral lands should be treated as subject in this respect to this general policy. It has been frequently said by our courts of last resort that these tide lands do not really belong to the United States, and are not subject to disposition, but are simply by the United States held in trust for the new states that shall be carved out of the public domain.

That the general government is the owner, and might, if it chose, dispose of them as it pleased, I have no doubt. But it is not difficult to perceive that the disposition of the tide lands in the outlying district of the United States might, when new states should be carved out of the public domain, create difficulties in the admission of the same as states of the Union; hence the policy of the government. It is fair to conclude, in construing the act of Congress providing for the disposition of the public lands of the United States, that the Congress only intended to provide for the disposition of such lands as havé been held for disposition under the general policy of the government.

If the general government has no title in these lands, and holds them simply in trust, the title being in the future state, then a person having a lode location near the shore of the sea might not be permitted to follow his ledge on the dip beyond the shore line, because it is very apparent that, if the United States cannot dispose of this land, any grant it may convey in the sale of a mining claim must stop at the line of the grant, and cannot extend into lands that the United States does not own. It is well ■ settled that, where agricultural lands have been conveyed by patent, a party obtaining title to a contiguous mining claim cannot follow the dip of his vein beyond a point where a line let fall perpendicularly from the boundaries of the agricultural land would strike the dip of the vein.

It is claimed on the part of the plaintiff that the patented lands constituting their several lode mining claims run to the shore of Gastineau channel, and that there is no land between their lode claim and the said channel upon which the defendants could lawfully enter to 'make exploration or discovery; that the apices of any veins that can be found above mean high tide along the shore of said channel, opposite their several patented claims, are all within the boundary lines of their several patented claims; that the meander line fixing the boundaries of their several claims, while indicated in the patent and survey by several stakes and monuments, is in fact the meander line of Gastineau channel, notwithstanding such fixed boundary points as are described in the patent. In aid of the description of the land covered by their several patents, they offer the field notes of the survey made by the United States mineral surveyor Garside, and also the oral testimony of Garside, to show the intent and purpose of said survey in fixing said boundary line along Gastineau channel. When this evidence was offered, objection was made by the defendants, on the ground that the same was incompetent, and that the patent is the only competent evidence that can be offered in this case to show the lands embraced by the same.

The contention of the defendants is that the field notes of the surveyor cannot be introduced to help out the lines established by the patent, or to explain the same; that there is no latent or patent ambiguity in the conveyance issued by the government, and that there is therefore nothing to explain.. It is not claimed by the plaintiff that there is any mistake ;in the patent. And not only are the field notes of the surveyor that were offered in evidence objected to by the defendants, but also the oral testimony of Surveyor C. W. Garside as to what his intentions, were in fixing the line of the claim owned by plaintiff bordering On Gastineau channel. My recollection is that the field notes referred but once to the tide water of the channel. Nothing in the field'notes and nothing in the patent is found fixing the boundaries of the claim on that side by the line of the sea or the shore line of Gastineau channel. The court is unable to see in what particular the field notes oFthe surveyor aid or explain the directions and distances given in the patent itself. .The field notes are therefore rejected as evidence in this case, as also are the statements of the witness Garside as to his intentions in making the survey of said claim. It is evident that the surveyor’s intentions did not enter into the consideration of the land department when title was con<a id="p323" href="#p323" data-label="323" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*323</a>veyed to the land in question. They cannot, therefore, be considered in determining what land the government intended to convey by its patent. Garside’s testimony, however, that he placed the different stakes that bounded the claim on the side next to Gastineau channel, upon the line of ordinary tide is, perhaps, testimony-of importance in the case.</p>

Another fact that may be considered of some importance in determining the rights of the parties to this action is the width of the claim that was patented, and that is now owned by the plaintiff. An examination of the maps •offered in evidence, and the patent itself, as to the distances, shows that the claim is not 600 feet wide, and that the claimants did not take 300 feet on each side of their vein, as was their right under the law. Having taken less than the full width on the side bordering on Gastineau channel, the only possible reason that could exist to indicate why the claim was not taken of its usual width must have been the limit that was fixed by natural conditions, viz., the shore line of Gastineau channel.</p>

This stake was placed upon the bank, as close to the edge of the same as it could be planted, and where the bank from the beach rises abruptly some six feet or more, and as close to the tide line as it could well be placed without danger of being washed away by the waves that would roll •up at times from the sea, the waves having evidently at times washed away the ground up the edge of the embankment on which the post was placed. MacDonald, the manager ■of the plaintiff corporation, stated in the presence of the •court that this stake, so far as he knew, was one of the posts <a id="p324" href="#p324" data-label="324" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*324</a>marking the boundary of plaintiff’s claim. Another point marked and designated on this line as at the corner of the mill was evidently below mean high tide before the beach at the shore of the sea had been filled in by débris and waste from the mill. But at the point where the stake is there was a. controversy between MacDonald, on behalf of the corporation, and Barbridge, one of the defendants, as to whether the shaft of the defendants, a hole about six or eight feet deep that had been sunk near the post referred to, was in part within the boundaries of the patented claim, or whether the same was all outside. The court is of the opinion that it is not important whether said shaft is in part within, or in part or wholly without, the lines of the patented claim. In Railroad Co. v. Schurmeier, <a href="/us/74/0272-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="7 Wall. 272" data-case-ids="3450258" data-case-paths="/us/74/0272-01">7 Wall. 272</a>, <a href="/us/74/0272-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="7 Wall. 272" data-case-ids="3450258" data-case-paths="/us/74/0272-01">19 L.

Many cases of this character are presented, but they all refer to surveys of the public agricultural lands of the United States and certain rules of the department that require the United States surveyors, in subdividing <a id="p325" href="#p325" data-label="325" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*325</a>sections where a portion thereof would border upon the sea or upon lakes or river or tide waters, not with a view of excluding any of the land from the fractional portion of the section, but to determine.the price to be paid, etc.; and that, notwithstanding such meander line so established on the shore of a lake or sea, the land should run to the sea. But I fail to see the force of the principles and theories announced by the court in Railroad v. Schurmeier, and many other cases to the same effect, when applied to the case at bar. No authority has been shown vesting in the United States mineral surveyor any right or authority to establish a meander line, and the department very evidently refrains from any mention of such a line in the patent. No authority is shown under the rules of the Department of the Interior, having the sale of the public lands in charge, for arranging or establishing any such meander lines upon the mineral lands. It would, therefore, seem that in this case the court is bound by the usual rule that the language of the patent governs, and I am therefore compelled to hold practically that the lines of the claim in controversy are established according to the points, lines, courses, and distances mentioned in the patent.</p>

Whatever may be the -rule for determining grants where they run to the sea — and unquestionably under all such descriptions they run to ordinary high tide and are bounded thereby —we have no such description in this patent, and we are bound to determine the boundaries of the land by the patent itself. But it is not always easy to determine to just what point the land embraced in the patent extends, because of the monuments being destroyed and thrown down or removed, as it is claimed in some instances they were in this case. We may be compelled to resort to parol evidence, surveys, and measurements, to determine the point at which monuments were, placed and should be found. Such evidence has been offered and received in this case. The testimony of Garside, the original surveyor of these claims, is to the effect that the posts and monuments, as originally set, were placed upon the tide line, and that the line indicated between the monuments was as near on the tide line as it could be placed. Considering this testimony, and considering further the width of this claim, its relation to the tide line, the quantity of land conveyed being less than is usually covered in a full-sized mining claim, 600 by 1,500 feet; the fact that the full 300 feet is not taken on the side line next to Gastineau channel — all these matters may be reasonably considered in determining where the line of this claim really was ancT is, and what and where the lands are as described in the terms of the patent. While this question Ts' not’ one necessary for the court to decide in this case, I am inclined to the opinion that the patented claim owned by the plaintiff company ran to ordinary high tide and-included all the land above high tide within its limits, and that there was, in fact, no land above high tide upon which a location could be properly <a id="p327" href="#p327" data-label="327" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*327</a>made by the defendants.

The defendants were about to sink a shaft at a point close to the shore of Gastineau channel, over which the tide ebbed and flowed every day, and which was immediately above some of the workings of plaintiff in this case. These people were here upon this land below mean high tide, where they could acquire no right whatsoever, and where they were trespassers upon the lands and rights of the United States. The plaintiff is the owner of several patented claims; has expended many hundreds of thousands of dollars in developing the same and in extracting minerals from the orés therein; has, it is said, distributed among its stockholders from $4,000,000 to $5,000,000; is employing about a thousand men; and has followed down on the dip of its vein until it is now beneath the waters of an arm of the sea called “Gastineau Channel,” and immediately beneath this particular shaft of the defendants. It further appears that any work on the shaft of defendants in question, and the blasts being exploded there, so increase the flow of water through the roof above where the plaintiff is taking out ore that, if continued, it will drive plaintiff from its mine and prevent the further working of the same; and because of this result plaintiff asks that the defendants be restrained from such ^vork.</p>

One may not' sink on the line of his own' ground and excavate it in such a way as to allow his neighbor’s land to fall into <a id="p328" href="#p328" data-label="328" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*328</a>the excavation so made. Matters of this character have been so frequently determined that they now need no discussion and no citation of authorities; the proposition is settled beyond controversy. Can it be said, then, that these defendants, having no rights whatever below tide water in the location and development of a mine so situated, may be permitted to enter upon and so work the same as to destroy the property of the plaintiff, which is engaged in a like business, but has reached the point beneath the tide waters by following the dip of a vein the apex of which is within its patented land ? While it is true that, under the general policy of the government, lands below tide water are not for sale and disposition, and have never been held for sale and disposition by the United States, these tide lands having been reserved to the states that might be organized out of the territories of the United States, the purposes for which these lands are held in trust for the future state are trade, commerce, navigation, and the convenience of the public, and for such purposes only. If the plaintiff is usurping any of the rights of the government in the land it now possesses, by the working of its mining claim beneath the water of the sea, no one, save the United States, through its proper channels, can complain. They are in possession, and by their efforts are adding millions to the wealth of the country. The defendants, though trespassers upon the rights of the United States in going upon and locating land below ordinary high tide, were they in nowise damaging any one else, could not be stopped, perhaps, except upon complaint by the government. But, as before stated, even if they were rightfully in possession of the ground where their shaft is being sunk, and were operating in a way to injure and destroy property owned by the plaintiff, the court is of the opinion that the defendants should be restrained and enjoined from further work. Under the facts and circumstances of this <a id="p329" href="#p329" data-label="329" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*329</a>case, the court is compelled to the conclusion that the defendants should be restrained and enjoined from further continuing the sinking of their shaft, or further interfering in this behalf with the rights of the plaintiff.</p>
