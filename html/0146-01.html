While the permit given by the commanding officer of the District of Alaska to Ford on May 25, 1900, conferred no right as against the United States, nor any title to the land, yet it affords some evidence of his peaceable entry and possession ■of both lots mentioned therein. His entry upon the lots, the erection of the dwelling and stable, clearing, building roads and graded ways, and the use of both lots for the very purposes mentioned in the permit, leave no doubt that he was in possession of the lot in question at all times from May 25, 1900, to and at the time when the plaintiff entered thereon. It is not necessary, to maintain his possession of both lots, that he should erect a house or dwelling on each, any more than it is necessary for a claimant under the homestead law to build a dwelling on each legal subdivision of his claim. It appears that both lots were reasonably necessary and actually used for the purposes for which he took possession of them. They were contiguous, and the lot in controversy was necessary to the full enjoyment of the adjoining lot upon which the dwelling and stable stood, and was in constant, open, and notorious use in connection therewith ; and that is sufficient. The plaintiff acquired no right ■of possession by intruding upon that of the defendant. His act was a mere naked trespass. It was an unwarranted intrusion upon the peaceable possession of another citizen, and affords plaintiff no ground for relief. Atherton v.
