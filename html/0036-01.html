No water rights, ditches, or rights of way are mentioned in the deed, and there is no evidence that any were intended to pass by the conveyance; nor did they pass by the words, “including everything appertaining thereto.” The deed alone is evidence of nothing relating to this case, except that Juneau parted with his interest in the mine on which the main was used. No other deed from Juneau is produced, and from all that appears to the contrary he has never parted by deed with his title to the property.</p>

The only evidence on this point is a copy of what appears to be a marshal’s certificate of sale in the suit of N. A. Fuller et al. v. R. T. Harris et al. (commenced in this court), in -which one Barton Atkin, then United States marshal for the District of Alaska, certifies that by virtue of an execution in the above cause, attached the 26th day of May and the 29th <a id="p40" href="#p40" data-label="40" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*40</a>day of October, 1886, he was commanded “to make the amount to satisfy the balance on execution in my hands in the said cause to satisfy the judgment in this action, with interest thereon and costs.” This certificate, as appears from the copy before me, was not issued until September 18, 1889, more than two years from the day of sale, and was not recorded until September 28, 1889.</p>

Civ. Code Or. § 293, p. 169. The date of the order of confirmation also fixes the date after which a lienholder may redeem, and a purchaser demand a conveyance. Sections 298, 301.

Even if there had been an •order of confirmation, the property may have been redeemed, or the certificate of sale assigned, and the purchaser not entitled to a conveyance; but, there being no such order, the time for redemption has not yet commenced to run, and a purchaser would not be entitled to the marshal’s deed.

The ditch ends were overgrown with weeds. It was broken and washed out in the middle, although the boxes in the rocks were sound; was washed away at the gates; and there were breaks on the lower side. In June, July, and August, 1888, when he saw it, it was in the same condition as that in which he described it to have been in 1889. No water was <a id="p43" href="#p43" data-label="43" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*43</a>running through it, and from the commencement of the ditch to the gates it could not have carried water. Twice before — in August and September, 1887 — he found it about the same, with the ditch full of sand. He was there every season from the time the ditch was dug. In 1886 there was water there, but he could not say whether or not it was wash water from the mountains. It was not water from the gulch. He thinks Harris and Juneau used it right along from the time it was dug in 1882, 1883, 1884, and 1885, and no one worked it after that, so far as he knew. He saw no work done there in 1887 or 1888. He went to work there himself about July 30, 1889, to repair it, but at that time defendant Coon came along and claimed it.</p>
    <p id="b67-4" data-blocks='[["BL_67.4",67,[253,1083,1144,784]]]'>It seems conclusively established by the evidence that the water was not used, and that no work was done on the ditch in 1886 by any one, nor at any time after 1885 by Harris or Juneau or by their successors in interest. So far as the original locators were concerned, the ditch was abandoned in 1885. Juneau parted with his interest in the placer claims on which the water had been used on July 22, 1884, but he made no conveyance at any time of his interest in the water rights, ditch, or right of way. Harris was involved in litigation in the Fuller suit, under which, by virtue of an execution issued in May, 1886, his interests in said placer claims were sold, but not his interests in the water rights here in dispute, although there was, as hereinbefore stated, an ineffectual attempt to' sell the property in September, 1887.</p>

So far as they are concerned, there was then an actual abandonment. For one year and more thereafter neither they nor any one claiming under them exercised <a id="p44" href="#p44" data-label="44" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*44</a>ownership over the water rights, ditch, or flume, and they must be deemed to have lost all title, claim, or interest therein. Indeed, there was no actual use of the water by any one from the fall of 1885 until the use by defendants in 1888, although it is true that in the fall of 1887 defendants sent up some lumber and fixed up the boxes. Whatever was •done by defendants, however, had no more effect upon subsequently acquired rights of plaintiff than if it had been done by strangers, for defendants failed to connect themselves in any way with the title of the original locators, and never made, nor attempted to make, any independent location or appropriation prior to that of plaintiff. Even if they had so connected themselves with that title, the evidence shows clearly an actual abandonment and a cessation of work for more than a year thereafter, before defendants attempted to exercise any rights of ownership.</p>
