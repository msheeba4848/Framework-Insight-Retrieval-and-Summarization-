What was the intention of Congress in passing it? If the evident purpose was to establish a form of local self-government, that purpose must be kept steadily in view. That such a purpose was evident is apparent from an examination of these three sections under consideration. It is clear that Congress intended to provide a local town government as well as a local school government. It is also clear that the two are, in some respects, so intimately related that neither could perform all of its statutory powers and duties without the active co-operation of the other. It is the duty of the town council “by ordinance to provide for necessary maintenance of public schools,” and it is quite clear that the school board could not perform that duty. The council is the only body having legislative power, and the only body having authority to levy taxes for the maintenance of public schools. Having in mind the idea of establishing a system of public schools controlled by the people residing within the town district, it must have occurred to Congress that the power of levying taxes and providing funds for the maintenance of <a id="p367" href="#p367" data-label="367" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*367</a>such schools must be lodged in some local body, and the town council was chosen. That there might not be any doubt, however, about the scope of the board’s legislative powers, Congress provided that “the exclusive supervision, management, and control of the public schools and school property” shall be vested in the school board. The word “exclusive” shows clearly that it was the intention of Congress to shut out any other person or body from any pretended or real authority in the power then vested in the board. The use of the word excludes any possible construction or implication which will give the council any “supervision, management, or control of the public school or school property.” The words “supervision, management, and control” are broad in their meaning. “Supervision” means having general oversight of, especially as an officer vested with authority; oversight; inspection; the act of supervising; superintendence; and this authority of oversight, superintendence, and inspection, is conferred exclusively upon the school board. “Management” is the act of managing, carrying on, directing, conducting, administering, superintending. “To control” is to exercise a directing, restraining, or governing influence over; to direct; to regulate; to guide. If, then, it be admitted that every other person or body is specially excluded from any power of supervision, oversight, inspection, superintendence, management, carrying on, directing, conducting, administering, controlling, restraining, governing, regulating, or guiding the public schools or school property, we may, in view of the general plan, inquire, what is left for the council to do in relation to the public schools ?</p>

To maintain is to hold or preserve in any particular state or condition; to keep from falling, declining, <a id="p368" href="#p368" data-label="368" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*368</a>or ceasing; to supply with means of support; to provide for, to sustain, to keep up. It is the duty of the council by ordinance to provide necessary maintenance of public schools; to keep them from falling, declining, or ceasing; to supply the means of support; and this shall be done, when necessary, by taxation, under the fifth subdivision of section 201. No fitter words could have been chosen to impose upon the council the legislative power and duty of providing the means to support the public schools, and upon the board the executive power and duty of superintending, directing, and governing them.</p>

This section, as amended, declares that the treasurer of the corporation shall be ex ohicio treasurer of the school board, and also provides that 50 per' centum of all license moneys received by the clerk of this court within the corporation shall be paid over by him to the treasurer of the corporation. “The money received by the treasurer of the corporation from the clerk of the court for licenses shall be used, under the direction of the council, for school purposes.”</p>

But it is often used in other senses. It is a common practice i.n legislative proceedings, on the consideration of bills, .for parties desirous of securing amendments to them to precede their proposed amendments with the term ‘provided/ so as to declare that, notwithstanding existing provisions, the one thus expressed is to prevail, thus having -no greater signification than would be attached to the conjunction ‘but’ or ‘and’ in the same place, and simply serving to separate or distinguish the different paragraphs Or sentences.” Georgia Banking Co. v. Smith, <a href="/citations/?q=128%20U.S.%20181" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="128 U.S. 181">128 U.

An examination of the word “provided” at the beginning of the first proviso in section 203 both in the original and amended act clearly shows that it is used there with the ordinary meaning of “but” or “and.” The word .“provided” separates two clauses which have no relation to each other. The following clause neither excepts anything from the preceding clause, nor qualifies nor explains it in any way. This is made clearly apparent by comparing the first and second provisos. The second is clearly a proviso, and the clause following the word “provided” therein does except something from the operation of the sentence which immediately precedes the word “provided.” The word “provided” in the first proviso lias only the meaning of the conjunction “and” or “but,” while the second has the full significance of a proviso. Any argument based upon the word “provided” in the first alleged proviso, or upon the fact that the phrase, “under the direction of the city council,” is contained in a proviso, is, therefore, without foundation.</p>

Eet us examine <a id="p371" href="#p371" data-label="371" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*371</a>it for a moment, keeping in view the evident intention of Congress to establish a municipal government on the one hand, to be controlled by the city council and other city officials, and a school -government on the other hand, controlled by the school board and school employés. Section 203 provides that the treasurer of the corporation “shall be •ex officio treasurer of the school board,” and then provides for his oath and bond. Then follows the first proviso that 50 per centum of all license moneys received by the clerk •of this court within the town limits shall be paid over to the treasurer of said corporation by the clerk. Then comes the important sentence as follows: “The money received by the ' treasurer of the corporation from the clerk for licenses shall be used, under the direction of the council, for school purposes.” The gist of the whole matter lies in the meaning of the words “under the direction of the council.” What does this phrase mean, and what power or duty does it confer upon the city council? Does it except anything from the •exclusive supervision, management, and control of the public schools and school property given to the board by section 202? Fortunately, this phrase has been more than once analyzed and carefully construed, by courts of the highest resort, and their construction of the phrase must determine this action. In a case decided, by the Supreme Court of Vermont the phrase was examined and construed. The question there arose upon the right of the clerk to issue certain process which could only be issued under “the direction of the judges.” The court says in its opinion:</p>

The-town council is empowered, and it is its duty, to provide by ordinance for the “maintenance” — that is, for the support <em>; </em>that is, to raise means to support — the public schools. And under the principle announced in this Vermont case the-school board will not be required, by the phrase “under the direction of the council,” to seek the council’s approval for the expenditure of the school fund any more than the clerk was required to seek the approval of the judges for issuing the warrant, and for the same reason, viz., that by other statutory provisions each had power to perform the act in question, and such power so expressly given was not lim-<a id="p373" href="#p373" data-label="373" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*373</a>íted by the phrase “under the direction of the council” (judges).</p>

That was a suit in equity by the railroad to remove a cloud from its title to a tract of land, being a portion of its land grant. The land was selected by the railroad company under its grant, and the selection was denied by the Secretary of the Interior, who issued a patent for the same to Wiggs, the defendant.

The company had prepared lists of certain lieu lands which it desired to select, and had filed its list with the register and receiver in the various land offices. Thereafter the Secretary of the Interior modified and changed the conditions to be performed by the company in completing its selection, and then claimed the right to require said lists to be modified before he would finally approve, allow, and adjust said selections. He then claimed that the railroad company had acquired no legal or equitable title to the lands in question. So that the case-stood as the case at bar stands. The Secretary of the Interior denied the right of the company to its lands, because they had not been selected under his direction, and this question became an important one in <em>the </em>consideration of the case. The court said:</p>

We do not think it imports, as used, an approval of the selection by the secretary. * * ::= The act in terms provides that for the specified deficiencies ‘other lands shall be selected by said company in lieu thereof, under the directions of the Secretary of the Interior, in alternate sections, and designated by odd numbers, not more than ten miles beyond’ the 40-mile limit.

    <blockquote id="b399-4" data-blocks='[["BL_399.5",399,[143,710,1145,1361]]]'>“To make these selections ‘under the directions of the Secretary of the Interior’ is to make them in accordance with the rules and regulations prescribed by him. The object of this provision is undoubtedly that the Interior Department and the public may be advised as to what lands are appropriated -under the grant, and thereby withdrawn from settlement and entry as a part of the public domain, and that the government may be advised when the quantity grant is satisfied. To secure these purposes and uniformity in the manner of selection, the secretary was authorized to prescribe the procedure to which the company must conform in making these selections. But it is in terms prescribed that the ‘land shall be selected by said company.’ To ‘select,’ says Mr. Webster, is ‘to choose and take from a number; to take by preference from among others; to pick out; to cull.’ This power of choice is to be from among all the unappropriated odd-numbered sections of land ‘not more than ten miles beyond’ the 40-mile limit. It is to be exercised by said company. This phrase renders clear the interpretation to be. given to the words ‘under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior.’ The clause must be so construed that both these phrases may stand together, and both be given their full force and meaning. A construction of the phrase ‘under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior’ which would vest him with the power to dispose of the indemnity lands after the right of selection had attached, or vest him with authority arbitrarily to refuse to recognize a selection made by the company in proper manner, upon a proper basis of lands subject to the right of selection, or, by neglect or refusal to approve the selection, prevent the title to the indemnity lands from vesting in the grantee, would deprive the company of the right of selection. It would make the words ‘by said company’ surplusage, and deprive them of any effect whatsoever.”</blockquote>

In the case at bar the city council had the power, and it is its duty, under section 201, to provide for the maintenance of the public schools, the exclusive supervision, management, and control of which is given to the school board; and the phrase “under the direction of the city council” must be construed with reference to the evident purpose of Congress to impose upon the council the duty of maintaining, and upon the school board the exclusive duty of supervising, managing, and controlling. The raising of the money for the support of the schools, on the one hand, is the duty of the council; the expenditure of the money, on the other hand, is clearly included within the purpose and meaning of the law giving to the board the exclusive supervision, management, and control thereof. The town council can no more- expend that money by virtue of the phrase “under the direction of the council” than could the Secretary of the Interior prevent the selection by the railroad of the lieu lands. The purpose of Congress in both instances must be sought for upon examination of the whole law involved. . It was the duty of the secretary to provide general rules and regulations for all cases like that in question. But he could not select. That right belonged to the company. The purpose of Congress in passing the laws under consideration was to provide both a town and school government, each having specified powers, independent, yet not conflicting. It is the duty of the council, as a legislative body, to provide for the maintenance of the schools, and to that extent they have a general direction over the school fund. Concede that the special license fund is to be used “under the direction of the council,” but by whom? <a id="p377" href="#p377" data-label="377" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*377</a>The act does not say “by the council,” nor even “with the approval oí the council.” Then it must follow that it can “only be used by that body which has “the exclusive supervision, management, and control of the public schools and school property.” No other body could apply it to that use — the very use for which it is provided by Congress. To deny the right of the school board to expend the fund is to deny its use in the “supervision, management, and control of the public schools.” It is the same as to deny the right of the railroad to select its land. No one else there had the right to select; no one else here has the right to pay out the money. The council may direct, but it cannot pay. The expenditure of the fund is necessary to the supervision, management, and control of the public schools. It is not necessary to any power vested in the council. The school system established by the act would be destroyed without that power, for the council is specially and clearly excluded from any supervision, management, and control of the public schools by its exclusive lodgment in the board.</p>
    <p id="b401-4" data-blocks='[["BL_401.4",401,[146,1389,1148,783]]]'>“Under the direction of the council” means that in performing its legislative duty’of the maintenance of the public schools the council will consider that fund along with any other which can. be used for such support. It will provide .a sufficient fund for the support of the schools by general or special rules or ordinances, just as the secretary should provide for selections of lands, by general rules or regulations. Such fund, however, whether raised by taxation by the council or arising from licenses, will be placed in the hands of the treasurer as “ex officio treasurer of the school board,” and expended by that board only, and without the •consent or approval of the council for the purposes which Congress had clearly in its mind1 — “the supervision, management, and control of the public schools and school prop•erty.”</p>

In conclusion, it is the opinion of the court that the phrase “under the direction of the city council” must be construed in connection with the evident purpose and object in the mind of Congress to establish a town and school government, and to separate the duties and powers, respectively, between the two sets of officials; that the only direction which the town council has over the use of the school funds is that of considering them in determining the revenue and support which ought to be raised by taxation; that it is the duty of the council to so consider them, and'to that limited extent they are under the direction of the council for the purpose of determining what additional fund shall be raised, and none other.
