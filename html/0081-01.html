Their improvement by individuals, when permitted, is incidental or subordinate to the public use and right. Therefore the title and control of them are vested in the sovereign for the benefit of the whole people. At common law the title and dominion in lands flowed by the tide were in the king for the benefit of the nation. Upon the settlement of the colonies, like rights passed to the grantees in the royal charters, in trust for the communities to be established. Upon the American Kevolution these rights, charged with a like trust, were vested in the original states, within their respective borders, subject to the rights surrendered by the Constitution of the United States. * * * The new states admitted into the Union since the adoption of the Constitution have the same rights as the original states in the tide waters and in the lands under them within their respective jurisdictions. The title and rights of riparian or littoral proprietors in the soil below high-water mark, therefore, are governed by the laws of the several states, subject to the rights granted to the United States by the Constitution.”</blockquote>

It has been sometimes held that, where parties had held fishing grounds from time immemorial, a grant would be presumed. The tide lands in all territory acquired by the United States have been held in trust, it is said, by the United States for the benefit of the new states that might be carved out of such territory. The United States has avoided making grants of the tide lands to individuals or corporations, and, while the general government undoubtedly has the right and power to grant, for appropriate purposes, rights in the soil below high-water mark of tide waters, the fact that it has never done so destroys any claim of grant from the United States by reason of control of' such lands for a great period of time. No-presumption of a grant can arise where no grant has ever been made by the only authority having power to make it. The lands below high water in tide waters and in navigable streams under control of the states have been disposed of by grant under the authority of the Legislature of the several states. Where grants have been made under such conditions, it has sometimes been held that a party holding the possession, or exercising the right of fishery within certain limits for a number of years might obtain a title by prescription; a grant presumed because of the lapse of years and the continuous right exercised by the party. But statutes of limitation do not run against the king or against the state. Jaynes v. Wilkinson (Kan.

    <p id="b115-4" data-blocks='[["BL_115.4",115,[281,606,1149,1275]]]'>But it is said that the respondents have at times landed their nets, when taking fish, upon the lands of the complainants above high-water mark. As the complainants allege ownership in this land, and nothing has been presented, either by allegation or evidence, to controvert their right of ownership, it will be accepted for the purposes of this case. As the owner of the uplands, the complainants have an unquestioned right of way over the tide flats lying below high-water mark to the deep water. It appears by the testimony of some of the witnesses that there is only about 500 feet along the line of the complainants’ lands where the tide and overflowed lands are of a character suitable for landing fish with seines. It also appears, or is claimed, that the plaintiffs and their grantors have, from time immemorial, us'ed these lands along the 500 feet of their shore line as a fishery, and for the purpose of passing from their land to the deep water of the sea, and landing fish from their seines in returning from the sea. The unrestricted right of free passage to and from the deep waters for such purpose is one that may be properly maintained by the plaintiffs as an exclusive right, and may be maintained by them as against all persons except the United States. In Weber v. Harbor Commissioners, the court seems clearly to recognize the propriety of this doctrine in the use of the following language;</p>

It is said that the respondents “alternated” with the complainants in spreading their seines and drawing in the seines upon the banks, but that, when complainants did not move as quickly as respondents seemed to think they should, the latter did not wait for complainants to alternate with them, but again occupied the grounds-■to the exclusion of complainants. It is evident to the court that the complainants were hindered and prevented by respondents from the free use of their right of way from the uplands to the deep waters, over the 500 or 600 feet of tide lands described by the witness Martin in his testimony; that such hindrance and delay by the respondents, and their action in preventing the complainants’ free access to the deep water and return therefrom, were unlawful, and should not be permitted. The court is unable to understand why the respondents, who are engaged in the business of canning and taking salmon at various points along the coast, should seek to interfere with others in like business. Ordinary respect for the rights of others, and common decency and discretion in the management of their business, would seem to require these men, who are occupying other grounds, to the exclusion, perhaps, of other fishermen, to seek at least to-establish a custom of protection of their own fishing rights' and grounds by noninterference with others, instead of wantonly encroaching upon their ground. To allow such things to continue would result in quarrels, and probably bloodshed, as well as in destroying the business of fishermen conducting the same in a fair and legitimate way. Public poney seems to indicate that this should not be permitted. It is evident from the testimony that respondents have used seines in an unlawful manner in setting them across the entire mouth of <a id="p94" href="#p94" data-label="94" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*94</a>the creek. It is the evident intention of the law that seines should not be so set as to prevent the passage of salmon to their spawning places; hence the requirement that they should not be permitted to extend more than one-third the width of the stream.</p>

It must not be understood that persons can claim unlimited rights in this behalf. And, though complainants claim to own a mile of the shore, it seems that only 500 or 600 feet thereof are used and necessary for spreading seines and landing the same. Such a width of highway for this business is not unreasonable, and in the exclusive use of this complainants will be protected by the order of the court.</p>
