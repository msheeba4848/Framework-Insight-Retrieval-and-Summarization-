Where, however, the jury render a verdict upon evidence insufficient to justify it, or in violation of the law, it is the duty of the judge to set it aside and grant a new trial. The motion in this action is based upon the in<a id="p517" href="#p517" data-label="517" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*517</a>sufficiency of the evidence to justify the verdict, and that it is against the law.</p>

Neither is it denied that Ryan left it in charge of an agent and went outside in the late fall of 1899 to make arrangements, which he testifies he perfected, to build a large and substantial building thereon. The only conflict of testimony is over the character and kind of structure on the premises during the fall, winter, and spring of 1899-1900. This conflict is immaterial, for the •court instructed the jury, in effect, that Ryan could maintain' the former occupancy and possession gained by Linden, by his agent, during the winter, if he went out intending to return with material and build on the lot, and the testimony to that effect was undisputed.</p>

The law intends that such titles shall be fixed and secure. The jury, it is true", is empowered to hear, and, from the evidence, and the law as given to them by the court, to award the right of possession; but there must be some adherence to the rules of law and evidence, and, if not, the verdict must be set aside.</p>

For these reasons, the verdict will be set aside and a new trial awarded.</p>
