The lot in controversy had been settled upon by some unknown claimant prior to the time when either of the parties to this action laid claim to it, and on August 23, 1900, the defendant filed in the office of the recorder a notice of his intention to relocate the same. About a week thereafter he left Eagle for St. Michael, where he had been employed as topographer by the military authorities. Before leaving he informed plaintiff that he would not return until next summer. He made no entry or improvement upon the lot, nor did he at any time occupy it in any way. When he left the town, the lot still remained in the vacant and abandoned condition in which it was left by the prior claimant, and the only act performed by defendant showing any intention on his part to claim the lot was the notice filed in the recorder’s office.</p>

On September 30th the defendant unexpectedly returned from St. Michael, and, although he was fully informed in regard to plaintiff’s relocation of the lot, made no entry or improvement thereon. On October 13th the plaintiff made the first act of settlement and improvement upon the lot, by delivering two loads of lumber at and upon the same. This lumber was part of the material which the plaintiff had then purchased for the erection of two dwelling houses on the property, and it was delivered there with the intention on the part of the plaintiff of immediately building the houses. On the day following this act of possession and settlement the defendant entered upon the lot and began to tear down a small log structure which had been built thereon and abandoned by the first occupant, threatened to remove plaintiff’s building material, and sought to oust the plaintiff from the possession of the premises. Upon application of the plaintiff, a restraining order was issued, after which the cause came to issue and trial.</p>

    <p id="b134-4" data-blocks='[["BL_134.4",134,[321,741,1149,1219]]]'>These statutory provisions show that it was the intention of Congress to dispose of lots in town sites in Alaska only to those who would possess and use them. Title thereto can be obtained only through settlement occupancy. “Settled upon” means taken possession of. It includes such an improvement of the lot by the erection of buildings or fences, or by actual residence thereon, or by such other acts of possession and improvement, as clearly and unmistakably show that it is bona fide the intention of the settler to take and hold possession of the lot, and that his possession and improvement is intended to be permanent, and for himself. “Occupied” also means taken and held in possession, and one who uses a lot and occupies it in good faith with buildings or other improvements or property, which show his intention to possess and claim it under the town-site law, although he may not reside upon it, can acquire title thereto.

The improvements of a settler upon a town lot, by which he gains possession, are in themselves equivalent to an announcement of his intention to claim and hold the property under the law, and a notice of such intention, filed in the recorder’s office, adds nothing to his rights.</p>

He acquired the right thereby to the exclusive possession of the property and to its quiet use and enjoyment, and when, on the following day, the defendant entered, and began to tear down structures standing thereon, and not belonging to, erected by, or in the occupancy of himself, he became a trespasser and a wrongdoer. Plaintiff is entitled to an injunction to prevent the threatened attack upon his property, and to the decree prayed for in his complaint.</p>
