It is nowhere shown or alleged whether the matters related to the past or present, private or official, character or acts of the judge. Counsel who prepared and signed this motion gave themselves the whole field of fact or imagination from which, now or in the future, to suggest the character of the alleged matter, or the time of its occurrence. Nor are they more specific in relation to the date when the information reached the court and the judge became imbued with the alleged bias and prejudice. The allegations are vague, shadowy, and indefinite; good enough for calumny and slander, but wholly lacking in courageous and specific statement of fact.</p>

No fact at all is stated, only the mere conclusion that the judge of this court “has been for some time a personal enemy of” the defendant, and “had bitter personal feeling against” him. No fact upon which ill feeling can be based is related either in the motion for a new trial or in the affidavit; neither <a id="p618" href="#p618" data-label="618" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*618</a>a threat nor other discourteous language, nor any act or other evidence of enmity, on the part of the judge, is stated. The only evidence of such ill feeling is the mere assertion of the defendant Richards, and the assertion is distinctly made in his own language, “because affiant has good reason to believe, and therefore alleges the truth to be, that just before and during the trial of said cause, and while said cause was submitted, and before the rendition of the opinion of said court,” the judge of this court was of the erroneous opinion that the defendant Richards had related the aforesaid matters-to the department about him. In short, the allegation of personal enmity in the breast of the judge is based solely upon the alleged belief of the defendant Richards, and not upon any fact whatever. -Whether he has such a belief can never be tested by other evidence than his assertion. He alleges that within the hidden recesses of his mind he has a belief that there exists within the hidden recesses of the judge’s mind a prejudice. The basis of this alleged but hidden prejudice is the allegation that the judge has or had an erroneous impression, which has never been publicly exhibited by word or deed, that the defendant Richards had scandalized him. It is not shown by any fact that this assertion is true, nor is any such claim made by counsel for defendants. The-whole allegation of prejudice against the judge of this court is a willful, contemptuous, and unjustifiable attack upon the judge of this court by counsel and client, without a shadow of truth or fact to support it.</p>

It is based upon the allegation that prior to the trial the trial judge consulted with the United States district attorney in reference to the case, and conversed with witnesses on behalf of the United States prior to their testifying. It was very evident, from the questions which the district attorney asked the defendant Richards while on the witness stand, that the trial judge had talked with the district attorney about the conversation which the defendant Richards had at the Golden Gate Hotel with the trial judge. No evidence was then, or at any other time, produced by the defendants, or any one else, to show that the trial judge did consult with any witness in the case, and such is not the truth. In fairness to the defendant Richards, however, the court now states this to be the truth: That soon after the trial of the case of the United States v. Wright, Assistant District Attorney McGinn complained personally to the judge of this court that the jury in that case had been unfairly drawn <a id="p621" href="#p621" data-label="621" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*621</a>through the open venire system by the defendant United States Marshal Richards. Feeling that the charge against the marshal was a very serious one, and that it ought to be made only upon reasonable evidence and in the best of faith by the assistant district attorney, the trial judge, after hearing the complaint made by Mr. McGinn, and thinking the matter over, addressed a letter to him, asking for a detailed statement in writing. In answer thereto Mr. McGinn copied the letter, which was in the form of interrogatories, appended his answers, signed his name to each answer, and returned the same to the trial judge. A doubt having arisen in the mind of the court upon one question, the judge addressed another letter to Mr. McGinn, asking for a more complete statement. Mr. S. T. Jeffreys, one of the counsel in the case of Waterbury v. Ferguson, complained to the court about the same time that the jury in that case had been improperly approached, and the court declined to hear his statement, and said to him that it must be made in writing, because of the seriousness of the charge. Mr. Jef-freys made such a statement in writing, as a member of the bar, and delivered the same to the trial judge. The trial judge took these precautions for the purpose of preventing a charge of such a serious nature being brought against an officer of the court except upon what'appeared to be reasonable and fair evidence. So much distrust and scandal had already arisen in the administration of justice in the Nome court that the trial judge determined not to permit an action to be brought in so serious a matter except it appeared to be necessary to defend the existence of the court.</p>

While this is a quasi criminal prosecution, yet it is of such a peculiar character <a id="p622" href="#p622" data-label="622" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*622</a>that the court felt that it was justified in taking the action that it did. An attack on the integrity of the jury as a part of the court, the insidious and hidden methods by which such attacks are made, and the injustice. falling upon litigants therefrom, ought to impel any fair court to take every possible precaution to protect itself and those whose rights are intrusted to it for decision from such assaults. If the judge of this court is compelled to sit with folded hands and permit an}1- officer of this court unfairly to fill a jury for the purpose of swaying the decision one way or another, then the court becomes too contemptible and powerless to exist. Acting upon these impressions, and impelled, first, to protect the officers of this court from scandal, and, second, to protect the court and litigants from such outrageous attacks, the court did have a conversation with Mr. McGinn, who afterwards became a witness upon this trial. In that conversation the trial judge told him that Marshal Richards had, at the Golden Gate Hotel, on the evening of the trial of the case of the United States v. Wright, and while the jury was still out, repeated to him, the trial judge, without any solicitation, the statements which were contained in the questions asked by Mr. McGinn of Marshal Richards upon the witness stand. The trial judge did not speak to any other witness in relation to this case, or permit any other witness whatever to speak to him about it. The trial judge was not biased or prejudiced against the defendant Richards by reason of such conversation with Mr. McGinn, for that conversation was had as much to protect the marshal from an unjust assault as for the purpose of protecting the court and litigants from “packed” juries.</p>

The questions upon which this paragraph is based seem to have been those only which were addressed to the defendant Richards, and contained in the alleged errors numbered n, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18. No such objection appears to be made in the record with regard to the defendant Jourden. While such questions are in some cases, and under some circumstances, held to be objectionable, yet in this case it seemed the rule did not apply. This was a charge of conspiracy between Richards, Jourden, and Wright to fix the jury in the Wright case favorably to the acquittal of the defendant. The defendant Richards went upon the witness stand voluntarily, and testified, and section 149 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of Alaska (Act March 3,1899, c. 429, <a href="/citations/?q=30%20Stat.%201301" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="30 Stat. 1301">30 Stat. 1301</a>) provides that any person accused “shall, at his own request, but not otherwise, be deemed a competent witness, the credit to be given to his testimony being left solely to the jury, under the instructions of the court, or to the discrimination of the magistrate, or other tribunal before which such testimony may be given; provided, that his waiver of such right shall not create any presumption against him; that such defendant or accused, when offering his testimony as a witness in his own behalf, shall be deemed to have given to the prosecution a right to cross-examination.” The questions complained of were permitted to be asked the defendant Richards upon the theory that they affected his credibility, and tended to show conspiracy. As they did not affect Jourden, however, they will not be considered in connection with him.</p>

They are alleged to relate to the character of Jourden and the jurors Hayden, <a id="p624" href="#p624" data-label="624" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*624</a>Sullivan, and Shea, and to the character of other jurors in the Wright case, the Bohemian Club, and the justice or injustice of the verdict in the Wright case.

They allege accident and surprise in this respect, and that they could have produced Jack Jolly and other witnesses to deny his statements, and that their neglect to do so was caused by the belief on the part of counsel for defendant that it was unnecessary.</p>
    <p id="b648-5" data-blocks='[["BL_648.5",648,[328,1247,1143,473]]]'>Paragraph “d” of the motion for a new trial relates to newly discovered evidence, and is supported in part by the affidavit of P. C. Sullivan, the senior counsel for the defendants. Mr. Sullivan admits that he was in court, and the court will take judicial notice of the fact that he was present at the trial. He heard the testimony of Eames and Minto, who swore positively that he was present in the saloon, and conversed with Jourden before Eames and Playden were subpoenaed as jurors, yet he did not deny the statements.</p>

Mr. Sullivan’s testimony, however, could have been procured at the time of the trial, and must, therefore, be held to come too late. The testimony of Clarke and Niebling, even if true, is immaterial. I am inclined to the opinion that whether or not Sullivan had the <a id="p625" href="#p625" data-label="625" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*625</a>alleged conversation with Jourden is not so material as to affect the substantial rights of either of the defendants, and is, therefore, insufficient, under section 168, as a basis for a new trial. It is true that that fact impressed the court, and was referred to in rendering the former opinion; but, even if it be conceded that no such conversation did occur, there is still sufficient evidence to sustain the verdict against both defendants.</p>

Forest allege that Adam Johnson was not present at the time the subpoena tickets were made out in the marshal’s office, and could not, therefore, have heard the marshal instruct Griggs to go to Jourden’s saloon to serve the open venire. All of these parties were in attendance upon the trial, except Forest, who is the marshal’s chief deputy; and there is no showing that he was not in the marshal’s office, where his duties required him to -be, and could have been produced at the trial. I am satisfied that a new trial should not be granted upon these affidavits, because the evidence is not newly discovered, nor was it out of the power of the defendants to introduce it at that moment, for these persons were present as witnesses in the case, and were fully interrogated upon this phase of the case. Nor is the shade of difference between the evidence of Johnson and Richards in relation to Griggs going to the Lobby to serve the subpoenas so material as to affect the substantial rights of the defendants in this case. I am satisfied that Adam Johnson heard just what he says he did, and that the testimony of Griggs and Richards that the instruction to go to both Jourden’s and the Golden Gate Hotel was a concession to the truth stated by Johnson. An affidavit is filed by George Shea, one of the jurors in the Wright case, who now alleges that he was only a casual acquaintance of Wright’s, a matter about which he was fully examined on the witness stand. He also alleges <a id="p626" href="#p626" data-label="626" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*626</a>that the judge of this court permitted the affiant to visit, him in a social way, and then he discloses an alleged conversation' of that character between himself and the judge, wherein he was informed of the judge’s dissatisfaction with'his action as a juror in the Wright case. He then testifies that he was present in the courtroom when the judge rendered his decision in the case of the United States v. Richards and Jourden, on the 7th day of June, 1902. He swears positively that within 20 minutes after the conclusion of the judge’s decision a copy thereof was purchased on the streets of Nome, which had been published in the Nome News. The evident purpose of this testimony is to persuade. somebody other than this court that the judge had given out the opinion to a newspaper prior to its reading in open court. The truth about the matter is that when the judge of this court first opened the opinion to read it from the bench his stenographer approached, and asked if it might be given to the newspapers, and was answered in the affirmative. Hereto attached is a copy of so much of the opinion as was published in the Nome News on that date :</p>

They are called “findings of fact” by counsel for defendants, and many objections are taken and made thereto. Whether they are findings of fact, or only the statement of argument of the court, is not for this court now to determine. I am satisfied with almost every statement made therein, although the court did make one error in the statement that Jourden wás upon the official bond of Wright, and for that reason interested in his acquittal. Upon a further examination I ascertain the bond to be the bail bond of Wright, and not his bond as postmaster. The bond was only suggested, however, as proof of his intimacy and friendship with Wright, and it is equally as good proof whether it be called the official or bail bond. The mistake in designating the character of the bond did not affect any substantial rights of defendant Jourden, and cannot avail upon the motion for a new trial. This is true of many other objections urged by defendants ter statements contained in the opinion prior to the verdict. If, upon all the evidence in the case, the verdict is right, the substantial rights of the defendants are not affected, and therefore, under section 168, they would not be entitled to a new trial.</p>

On the other hand, the defendant Richards was and still is a sworn officer of this court, appointed by the President of the United States, and specially authorized by law, among other duties, to draw jurors upon open venire when ordered by the court.
