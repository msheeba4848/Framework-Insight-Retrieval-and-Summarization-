This allegation is followed by a statement of the circumstances and conditions under which the injury occurred; the term of plaintiff’s sickness and incapacity by reason of sickness, loss of time, expense of treatment and care in his efforts toward recovery. The particular specifications of the complaint are that at the time the injury was received it was the hour of extreme low tide at the port of Skagway; that the ship Tees was very much lower than tne platform of the wharf; that the appliances for unloading said vessel were defectively rigged, so as to make her unloading dangerous to the employés engaged in said work, and especially dangerous at the stage of the tide aforesaid.</p>
    <p id="b432-4" data-blocks='[["BL_432.4",432,[313,1451,1142,737]],["BL_433.1",433,[121,382,1145,526]]]'>The alleged defective appliances are described as follows: Said unloading was being done by means of rope and tackle fastened to the end of a beam, the other end of which was fastened to the mast, one end of said rope passing around a winch. The load, fastened to the other end, was drawn out of the hold, and swung onto the wharf. The end of said beam fastened to the mast was fastened at a point so low down upon said mast that, in order to lift the load sufficiently to pass over the platform of the wharf, said beam was placed in a nearly upright position, so that it was impossible to swing the load over the wharf by means of the boom itself,-making it necessary to draw said load over the wharf by hand; that while unloading the vessel in the dangerous manner aforesaid, by reason of the defective appli-<a id="p409" href="#p409" data-label="409" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*409</a>anees, the defendant negligently loaded too heavy a load upon said rope and tackle, to wit, 18 bales of compressed hay, and when the same was hoisted up to the end of the beam in the manner aforesaid libelant was instructed by defendant to draw the same by hand over onto the platform, when and where the said load was lowered upon the platform of the dock. This, the plaintiff charges, was a negligent and dangerous manner of unloading said vessel, and said load was precipitated upon the plaintiff, and crushed and broke his right leg.</p>
    <p id="b433-4" data-blocks='[["BL_433.4",433,[121,919,1145,96]]]'>The answer of the defendant is practically a denial of these allegations, putting the plaintiff to proof.</p>

The freight that was being taken from the steamer ■consisted of baled hay. Several bales were held together by a rope, and hoisted up to or above the level of the wharf, but, by reason of the shortness of the boom or the improper arrangement of the tackle, at the then stage of the tide, the load could not be swung over and landed upon the wharf. It did permit the swinging of the load to a point about even with the edge of the wharf, where the longshoremen engaged upon the work would seize the load at each end thereof, and swing it over the wharf platform far enough or to a point where it might be lowered upon the same. Several loads of hay, consisting of perhaps six bales, had been hoisted from the vessel and swung upon the wharf successfully, and without apparent danger to those engaged in the work. Later, nine bales were included in a single load and hoisted up through the vessel’s appliances as before. The two men, one of whom was the plaintiff, engaged in swinging these loads inward, so that they might fall upon the wharf when lowered, undertook to land the load of nine bales upon the <a id="p410" href="#p410" data-label="410" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*410</a>wharf as they had landed the other load. They made three trials to land this load, but failed, whereupon a stranger standing by came to their aid, one of the employés taking hold of the load at one end, the stranger at the other, and the plaintiff immediately in front. As it was swung inward,, over the wharf by the united strength of the three, and the men were straining to hold the load over the wharf, the plaintiff leaning backward pulling with his utmost strength,, his feet apparently somewhat under the load, the same was quickly lowered by the winchman, and fell upon and broke the right leg of the plaintiff. These are practically the facts, and all the facts, as described by witnesses engaged in the work, that resulted in the injury to the plaintiff.</p>
    <p id="b434-3" data-blocks='[["BL_434.4",434,[312,1067,1146,685]]]'>The attorney for the defendant complains of the plaintiff’s complaint, and challenges its sufficiency in the law. While, perhaps, the manner of stating the facts may be open to some criticism, it is believed that the allegations, as a whole, state a cause of action. The complaint being held sufficient, there remain two questions to be disposed of by the court on the motion now under consideration: Was the injury received by the plaintiff the result of carelessness on the part of the defendant in the imperfect construction of the appliances of the ship Tees for unloading and discharging its cargo, or of the careless use of appliances sufficient in themselves, or was the injury the direct result of the contributory negligence of the plaintiff?</p>
    <p id="b434-4" data-blocks='[["BL_434.5",434,[310,1765,1143,309]]]'>Referring to the statement of facts, it is proper for the court to add that it was admitted on trial, or the court and the counsel for the plaintiff were given to understand, that the unloading of the ship Tees was being done under the direct supervision of the mate of said ship, and for the purposes of this motion the court accepts this statement as true.</p>
    <p id="b434-5" data-blocks='[["BL_434.6",434,[310,2088,1141,95]],["BL_435.1",435,[111,371,1147,521]]]'>It is self-evident that, while the appliances of the ship were ample and sufficient for the discharge of its cargo at <a id="p411" href="#p411" data-label="411" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*411</a>ordinary stages of the tide, when the boom attached to the mast could be so lowered as easily to swing the loads being' hoisted from the hold over the wharf so that the same could be lowered thereon, without the load being swung upon the wharf by men. working thereon, yet, at extreme low tide, such-appliances were wholly insufficient for the work. The fault, if fault there was, was not in the original construction of the-appliances, but in the use of them at a stage of the tide which made therri unequal to the work for which they were originally made.</p>
    <p id="b435-3" data-blocks='[["BL_435.4",435,[114,906,1146,201]]]'>As the court understands the evidence, the only negligence or wrong on the part of the defendant was in using these appliances when insufficient for the proper performance of the work for which designed.</p>
    <p id="b435-4" data-blocks='[["BL_435.5",435,[115,1120,1146,732]]]'>The mate of the ship was intrusted with the work of discharging the cargo, and the ship’s appliances for that purpose were under his control and supervision. The manner of using these was left to his judgment and discretion, a discretionary power and authority which, in the judgment of the-court, constituted him, for the time being at least, “vice principal” of the defendant company. If there was negligence, fault, or wrong in the use of these insufficient appliances at the time the accident occurred, it was, therefore, the fault, negligence, and wrong of the defendant company. Was there fault in using these appliances ? There can be but one-answer to this question. There is always fault and always-wrong in using appliances unsuitable and insufficient for the service required.</p>
    <p id="b435-5" data-blocks='[["BL_435.6",435,[116,1866,1145,309]]]'>However strong and adequate these appliances at a higher stage of the tide, at the stage when being used they were beyond question insufficient and inadequate. That they could have been used with very slight danger in raising light loads there is no doubt; but it is equally evident that, when raising heavy loads, danger from their use was increased.</p>

This, in a measure, must be conceded, but whether the plaintiff knew, •or should have known, the danger to which he was exposing himself in the use of insufficient appliances, is not, perhaps, quite so clear.</p>
    <p id="b436-4" data-blocks='[["BL_436.4",436,[341,873,1143,575]]]'>The testimony of the plaintiff is not altogether satisfactory; indeed, the plaintiff, when testifying, seemed to be unable to explain the conditions around him at the time the injury was received. Whether this inability arose from the natural diffidence and modesty of the man, or from mental inability, the court was not able at the trial to determine. That the plaintiff knew that the appliances being used were insufficient and inadequate, there can be no doubt. That he realized the danger in using them in the manner in which they were'employed at the time of the injury does not appear.</p>

Indeed, men of ordinary intelligence and good judgment would not always agree upon the theory that the danger was so evident that plaintiff must have apprehended it. It would seem reasonable that the plaintiff might have placed himself in the position he did in swinging the load upon the wharf many times without injury to himself, and doing the work in the same manner it was done at the time of the injury. Technically, undoubtedly, when the plaintiff found upon trial that, with the aid of his fellow workman, it was impossible for the load to be swung upon the wharf because of its great weight, he should have refused to attempt it; the load should have been lowered again to the hold of the ship, and a portion of it removed, so that a lighter load, as before, could have been swung upon the wharf without danger. But, if there wTas technical negligence on the part of the plaintiff,, it must be remembered that this work of unloading was being done under the personal supervision of the company,, or its trusted agent, and if it was the technical duty of the <a id="p414" href="#p414" data-label="414" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*414</a>plaintiff to have refused the work of swinging the unusually heavy load upon the wharf, and if danger was thereby increased, this should have been far more apparent, and was more apparent, to the mate of the ship, supervising the work, than to the inexperienced longshoreman actively engaged in its performance.</p>

The -plaintiff was stationed on the upper deck to receive the cargo as it reached him, loaded in slings, from the hold. He con■ducted the slings to the side of the vessel, and started the load down the skids to the dock. Other men, some from the crew and some from the shore, were at work in the hold filling the slings with cargo; and one Bronson, a man from the shore, had charge of the steam winch by which the cargo <a id="p416" href="#p416" data-label="416" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*416</a>was hoisted and lowered. Bronson’s winch was between the decks, and it was his duty to operate it according to the signals to be given to him by the plaintiff by blowing a steam whistle. The signal to raise the load was one blast, the signal to stop was one blast, and the signal to lower was two blasts. According to the testimony of the plaintiff, after the work had proceeded for an hour or more, and when the sling of cargo had been hoisted from the hold and conducted by him to the side of the vessel, he blew one blast to stop, which was not heeded, whereupon he repeated the signal almost immediately, but that Bronson, instead of stopping, lowered the sling load, and it struck the plaintiff, and led to his injuries. Everything testified to by the plaintiff, it is said, was contradicted by the witnesses for the defendant. The ground of recovery was the incompetency of the winch-man, the winchman being deaf, and otherwise incompetent; and these facts, if they were facts, were known to the plaintiff before the injury occurred. It seems in this case that two of the instructions requested by the defendant and refused embodied the proposition that, if the plaintiff had information that the winchman was incompetent, and continued to work without objection, he was not entitled to recover for an injury caused by the winchman’s incompetency. The verdict was for the plaintiff. A motion for new trial was filed, and the motion was denied.</p>

This was proper, and any doubts we have on the subject are resolved on the same side. It is clear that, as to the manner and method of the work in hand at the time Murray was injured, the danger and risks were as well known to him as to any other servant of the company there employed, either as superintendent, foreman, or ordinary laborer, and we are of the opinion that, as to the apparent dangers and risks in carrying on the work, Murray assumed them with his employment. But the case shown requires us to go farther. While Murray assumed the risks attendant upon the operation, and knew that there was danger, the question is presented whether, in assuming the known and apparent risks, he also assumed the risks resulting from unknown defects in the tools and appliances furnished b}' the railroad company. The loop that broke —the breaking of which was the proximate cause of Murray’s injury — was defective, and the negligence of the company in furnishing it is conceded. The defect, while it was more or less apparent, and was discoverable upon slight inspection, was not known to Murray, nor probably to any other employé of the railway company.</p>

In the above-cited case it was evident that there was wrong on the part of the railroad company, as well as of the fellow servant of Cummings; but without the negligence of the railroad company the injury would not have been sustained.
