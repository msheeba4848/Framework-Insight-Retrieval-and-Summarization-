A man may wash a single pan of dirt taken from tbe surface or along the bank of a stream, and obtain such results as satisfy him that the ground contains precious metals in sucb quantity as induces him to make a location. He may, with an ordinary miner’s shovel, wash sufficient sand or gravel that be finds upon the bank of a stream, using tbe shovel as a pan, and obtain results that induce him to believe that sucb amount of tbe precious metals are to be found in the land as will warrant him in taking it and working it as a placer claim.

Indeed, important discoveries are known to have been made by miners in digging in tbe sand and gravel upon the banks of a stream with nothing more than a common sheath knife. In other cases large and expensive excavations have been made before mineral was discovered, and even without a discovery of mineral at all. Gold has sometimes been found in the gravel along the banks of streams, or tbe naked bedrock, without any excavation whatsoever. But that the discovery must be made in some form, as a necessary prerequisite to a lawful location of mineral land, is an imperative requirement of tbe mineral laws of the United States.</blockquote>

    <p id="b158-14" data-blocks='[["BL_158.14",158,[337,1975,1148,255]],["BL_159.1",159,[285,394,1146,952]]]'>It will be observed that, while the motion for a new trial in this case is signed by counsel A. K. Delaney and R. W. Jennings on behalf of the defendants, the claimed affidavit attached thereto and signed by Mr. Jennings was not sworn to by him. It is unquestioned that, to sustain a motion for <a id="p135" href="#p135" data-label="135" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*135</a>a new trial on the ground of improper conduct on the part of the jury, a showing must be made by affidavit. Some of the facts connected with the transactions referred to in the claimed affidavit are omitted. It will be conceded that the special findings submitted to the jury were not returned by them with their verdict, nor at all, and that the jury mingled with the body of the citizens without finding as requested by the plaintiff; but, in addition to this, the record discloses the further facts that, when counsel for the plaintiff requested the special findings, counsel for the defendants resisted the same, objected to the special findings as requested and as submitted to the jury, and took an exception to the ruling of the court in ordering the same submitted to the jury. At the time the general verdict was delivered to the court by the jury, and it was ascertained that the special findings had not been signed, counsel for the plaintiff asked leave to withdraw such special findings. These are facts that do not appear in the claimed affidavit.</p>
    <p id="b159-4" data-blocks='[["BL_159.4",159,[281,1361,1148,844]],["BL_160.1",160,[321,389,1147,365]]]'>While it is possible that the withdrawal of the special findings by the plaintiff did not in all respects cure the failure of the jury to pass upon them, the court is satisfied the jury acted in good faith; that their failure to sign and return the special findings was a mistake, and the result of misunderstanding on their part, and not the result of intentional wrong. And, inasmuch as the defendants, by their counsel, objected to these requests for special findings on the part of the plaintiff, and to their being submitted to the jury, the court was of the opinion that the party requesting might even then withdraw them by permission of the court, and that no reasonable objection could be made to such action of the court by defendants. The court is fully satisfied of the honesty and integrity of the jury and their desire to do right in the matter; that there was no willful misconduct on their part; the trial was absolutely fair; the case has been <a id="p136" href="#p136" data-label="136" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*136</a>fairly submitted, and the general verdict returned by the jury is right. Considering all the facts and circumstances of the case as now before the court, the court is of the opinion there was no error in the action of the court or jury that the defendants can take advantage of, or that should seriously affect the judgment of the court in passing upon this motion; and that the motion on that ground cannot be sustained.</p>
    <p id="b160-4" data-blocks='[["BL_160.4",160,[318,766,1148,1225]]]'>The next ground of the motion is that the verdict is not sustained by ,fhe evidence, and in specifying the particulars in which the evidence is insufficient the defendants state, first, “that there is no sufficient evidence introduced showing or tending to show a discovery of gold prior to location.” The evidence in the case shows that one of the witnesses describing the occurrences at the time of making the location stated that a discovery of gold was made on the claim before location, and no further question touching that matter was asked either on examination in chief or cross-examination. While this showing as to discovery may not be of the most satisfactory character, it is clear that there was evidence upon the question, and, in the failure of the defendants to show anything to the contrary, must certainly be deemed sufficient to sustain the verdict. The second insufficiency pointed out is “that the claim was not sufficiently marked on the ground so that the boundaries thereof could be readily traced, and that there was no reference to natural objects or permanent monuments; that the record of said claim did-not comply with the requirements of the Revised Statutes of the United States concerning the location and record of mining claims.” Upon these several points the evidence discloses the following facts:</p>
    <p id="b160-5" data-blocks='[["BL_160.5",160,[315,2004,1146,201]],["BL_161.1",161,[277,396,1149,419]]]'>The party locating cut off a standing tree some six feet above the ground, hewed the side thereof, and wrote their notice upon the tree claiming a certain number of feet up the creek and 330 feet on each side, making a claim of 20 acres, <a id="p137" href="#p137" data-label="137" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*137</a>as described in the notice. The notice was dated and signed. At the upper end of the claim a tree was cut in the same way, hewn on four sides, a notice posted thereon showing this to be the upper end of the same claim, indicating its width, the name of the claimants, etc. Upon the question as to what would be considered a proper compliance with the Revised Statutes of the United States, the court instructed the jury as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b161-4" data-blocks='[["BL_161.4",161,[274,840,1150,1175]]]'>“If the center line of a location lengthwise of the claim up and •down the creek is marked by a stake or monument at each end thereof, upon one or both of which is placed a written notice showing that the locator claims the length of said line upon the claim from stake to stake and a certain specified number of feet in width on each side of the line, such location of the claim is so marked that the boundaries may be readily traced, and, so far as the marking of the location is concerned, is a sufficient compliance with the law, unless the conditions or topography of the country, or the great amount of brush or timber on the land, would prevent a person making an honest and bona fide effort to trace or ascertain the boundaries from doing so. If, therefore, you find from the testimony in this case that Jamison, acting for the plaintiff, planted a stake or blazed •a tree at each end of the claim No. 5 Above Discovery, and placed thereon a notice claiming 1,320 feet up and down the creek and 6G0 feet in width for placer mining purposes, 330 feet of which was on each side of said stake and center line, then the location was distinctly marked on the ground so that its boundaries could be readily traced, within the meaning of the act of Congress, and in compliance with the law in that particular; unless you further find from the evidence in the case that the topography of the ground upon which said claim was located was such, or the great amount of "brush and timber thereon rendered the conditions such, that a person of ordinary Intelligence, seeing the said stakes or notices, or •either of them, and desiring by a bona fide effort to ascertain or trace the boundaries of said claim,'was unable to do so.”</blockquote>
    <p id="b161-5" data-blocks='[["BL_161.5",161,[278,2051,1148,151]],["BL_162.1",162,[333,392,1152,1113]]]'>If any fault can be found with this instruction, it is because it was too favorable to the defendants. It is a matter of great doubt whether the topography of the ground or the <a id="p138" href="#p138" data-label="138" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*138</a>amount of brush or timber growing thereon should in anywise affect the matter of location; but I was, and am still, of the opinion that a legal and fair location of a mining claim would not be made by placing notices upon a tree or stake that was situated in an inaccessible place, or where it was SO' surrounded by brush and trees growing upon the land that it could not be seen, or that a person passing over said' ground, and honestly seeking to make a location, could not,, because of such situation, be apprised of the former location having been made. If the conditions were such that a person passing over the land could see nothing to indicate that another had made a location, if whatever had been done towards a location at some prior time was so hidden that persons honestly looking for mineral land upon which to locate could not be expected to observe it, it should not be deemed such a location as the statute contemplates, or such a notice of a location as would sever the particular tract from the mineral lands of the United States, and such an imperfect location should not avail against one in good faith coming" upon the ground and making a subsequent location in accordance with law.</p>
    <p id="b162-4" data-blocks='[["BL_162.4",162,[330,1526,1152,301]]]'>But, as before stated, if the court erred in said instruction, it was in favor of the defendants, and therefore it was an error of which the defendants could take no advantage. The plaintiff alone, if any one, might complain of such instruction. It is the opinion of the court, therefore, that this ground of motion for a new trial is not well taken.</p>
    <p id="b162-5" data-blocks='[["BL_162.5",162,[328,1848,1153,359]]]'>On the question as to natural objects, etc., and a record, it is sufficient to say that the Revised Statutes of the United' States require a compliance with neither of these propositions in order that a valid location should be made. There was then no mining district, no record whatsoever shown to-have been made, and no local mining laws or customs were shown in evidence; so that these matters are not in the case.</p>
    <p id="b163-3" data-blocks='[["BL_163.3",163,[272,385,1149,796]]]'>
      <a id="p139" href="#p139" data-label="139" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*139</a>The next ground of objection is that the verdict is against the law; but in what respect it is against the law the motion does not point out, and therefore fails to specify any ground which the court is bound to consider. The following ground: “Errors of law occurring at the trial, and excepted to by the defendants,” is subject to the same criticism. What errors of law? The court is not required to go through the entire record, and ascertain what objections were made, and what were or are now claimed as errors of law. This ground, in order to challenge the court’s attention by motion, must contain specific and definite matters of claimed error. Failing in this, it will not be considered, except as possibly challenging the instructions that were given by the court on the trial, and the court is of the opinion that the case was fairly submitted to the jury on the instructions given.</p>
