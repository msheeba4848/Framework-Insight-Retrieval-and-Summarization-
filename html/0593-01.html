    <p id="b619-5" data-blocks='[["BL_619.5",619,[168,1029,1150,1163]]]'>The town of Nome has power, under chapter 21 of the Civil .Code of Alaska (Act June 6, 1900, c. 786, <a href="/citations/?q=31%20Stat.%20520" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="31 Stat. 520">31 Stat. 520</a>), “by ordinance to provide for necessary street improvements.” It may be conceded that it has power and authority, under section 269 of chapter 28 of the Civil Code, extending the mechanics’ liens to such cases, to file a -lien for work done and material furnished in improving a street in front of the property by one who requested the improvement to be made. The municipal corporation is a person under the provisions of that section. Metropolitan Ry. Co. v. District of Columbia, <a href="/us/132/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="132 U.S. 1" data-case-ids="5699198" data-case-paths="/us/132/0001-01">132 U.

But I do not discover that any question in relation to special assessment or the mechanic’s lien law arises under the allegations in the complaint demurred to. It is a suit in assumpsit to recover the reasonable value of money expended by the town of Nome, at the special instance and request of the defendant, in the improvement of the street in front of his property. It seems clear enough to me that the city may undertake such improvement under the wide power given it by statute, and, if the defendant requested the improvement to be made, an implied contract to pay for it may result. The complaint states a cause of action, and the demurrer may be overruled.</p>
