Section 2169, Rev. St. U. S. [U. S. Comp. St. 1901, p. 1333].</p>
    <p id="b136-4" data-blocks='[["BL_136.4",136,[321,610,1144,366]]]'>Section 8, art. 1, of the Constitution of the United States, provides that Congress shall have the power “to establish an uniform rule of naturalization.” In exercising this right, Congress has enacted that a free white person, or an alien of African nativity or of African descent, may be admitted to citizenship. This is the uniform rule established by Congress under the Constitution.</p>

By the treaty of cession between the United States and Russia it is provided that “the uncivilized tribes will be subject to such laws and regulations as the United States may from time to time adopt in regard to aboriginal tribes of that country.” In legislation by Congress we do not find any indication that Congress intends to deal differently with the Indians of Alaska than with any of the aboriginal tribes within the territorial limits of the United States.</p>

It will be observed that here the Indian is protected under the law the same as a minor or intoxicated person.</p>

    <p id="b137-5" data-blocks='[["BL_137.5",137,[276,913,1156,362]]]'>It was at one time the practice of our government to enter into contract with certain Indian tribes by treaty, but in 1871 it was enacted that “no Indian nation or tribe within the territory of the United States shall be acknowledged or recognized as an independent nation, tribe, or power, with whom the United States may contract by treaty.” Rev. St. U. S. § 2079.</p>

This seems to be the only method provided by law whereby an Indian may become a citizen.</p>

If he was not born within the territorial limits of the United States, but in British Columbia, as asserted by him, having no rights of citizenship there, and treated under the law of that government as an Indian without civil rights, then there is no law of the United States, of which this court is advised, whereby he mav be admitted to citizenship by the court.</p>
