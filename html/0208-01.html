It is contended that the complaint does not state facts which show any such interest in the plaintiff as will justify the court in granting an injunction upon his application. The demurrer admits the truth of the allegations that the plaintiff is a taxpayer, and is taxed for the public fund; that, unless restrained, defendants will hold the election, and incur the expense thereof; and that the plaintiff has no other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy to prevent the fund being thus depleted. It also admits his allegation that he will not be permitted to cast his vote at the election, though a qualified elector residing within the corporate limits of Nome, for the reason that he does not live within the boundaries of the Second Ward.

The right has been recognized by the state courts in numerous cases; and from the nature of the powers exercised by municipal corporations, the great danger of their abuse, and the necessity of prompt action to prevent irremediable injuries, it would seem eminently proper for courts of equity to interfere upon the application of the taxpayers of a county to prevent the consummation of a wrong, when the officers of those corporations assume, in excess of their power, to create burdens upon property holders. Certainly, in the absence of <a id="p212" href="#p212" data-label="212" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*212</a>legislation restricting the right to interfere in such cases to public officers of the state or county, there would seem to be no substantial reason why a bill by or on behalf of individual taxpayers should not be entertained to prevent the misuse of corporate powers.” Crampton v.

The jurisdiction of courts-of equity in this class of cases rests in the doctrine of trusts, and, while equity will not interfere to control the officers of a municipality while acting within the limits laid down for them by law, yet when they go outside of their well-defined jurisdiction, and threaten to misappropriate the funds intrusted to them, a court of equity will, at the suit of a taxpayer,, grant an injunction to restrain the illegal payment. It can make no difference in principle whether the amount threatened to be misappropriated be large or small. If it is a portion of the public funds, and is to be paid out without authority, and in violation of law, the proposed payment may be enjoined at the suit of a taxpayer.

One of the councilmen so elected was McPhee, who, after the passage of the ordinances set out in the complaint, and prior .to bringing this action, resigned his office, and left the District of Alaska. Under the provisions of Ordinance No. 54, he had been, just previous to his resig<a id="p215" href="#p215" data-label="215" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*215</a>nation, assigned to AVard No. 2 as created and bounded in Ordinance No. 52.

First. The action of the council in assigning the original seven councilmen to wards, without regard to their residence in the same, was void, and without authority of law. All members of the common council must be elected at large by all the electors of the town. State of Minnesota v.

The resignation of McPhee created a vacancy in the office of councilman, to be filled by all the electors residing within the limits of the town of Nome, and not those, only, residing within the Second Ward. Third. Because by the terms of Ordinance No. 56, even if the election could be held under its provisions, “one week’s notice of such election to fill such vacancy shall be given to the electors of the ward in which said vacancy occurs in such manner as said municipal council may elect.”</p>

A rule of court means uniformity, regulation in practice alike to all suitors, established and fixed, as much as a statute itself, and known to all litigants and attorneys. Spangler v. Atchison Ry.

It must have been so understood by Congress. It follows that the council can only provide for calling elections, appointing election officers, canvassing the returns, and declaring the result by ordinances, either general or special. What board, for instance, would canvass the votes as required in Ordi<a id="p217" href="#p217" data-label="217" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*217</a>nance No. 53, or declare the result of the election, or issue and sign the certificate of election ? The action of the mayor in calling the election of September 30th was without the ■sanction of any ordinance authorizing it, and is void. The appointment of the election officers, defendants herein, was equally without authority by ordinance, and must be held void. The election being wholly without authority, and in violation of law, affords no excuse or justification for incurring the expenses incident thereto, which must be paid from the public fund raised by taxation within the town. The plaintiff, as a taxpayer, has an interest in protecting the fund. The demurrer to the complaint will be overruled, and the injunction prayed for may issue.</p>
