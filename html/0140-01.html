    <p id="b167-3" data-blocks='[["BL_167.4",167,[267,733,1143,413]]]'>The answer denies that at the times mentioned in the complaint the defendants were copartners, or were at that time or since then carrying on business under said copart-nership of Frye-Bruhn &amp; Co.; denies making the contract of purchase by Frye-Bruhn Company, or by Frye-Bruhn &amp; Co.; denies indebtedness of Frye-Bruhn Company or of Frye-Bruhn &amp; Co., or any agreement to pay plaintiffs for meat in any manner.</p>
    <p id="b167-4" data-blocks='[["BL_167.5",167,[265,1160,1143,834]]]'>In this case the evidence tended to show that a relation at one time existed between Frye-Bruhn Company and Herman Meyer, which probably constituted them a partnership at will; that, prior to the contract of purchase referred to in plaintiffs’ complaint, the relation theretofore existing between said Frye-Bruhn Company and Herman Meyer had been terminated; that the partnership had been dissolved, and that the plaintiffs were fully notified of that fact before any shipments of meat, for the value of which suit was brought, had been shipped by the plaintiffs. The instructions to the jury in substance required that, if they found there was no partnership existing at the time that the purchase was claimed to have been made, or that Herman Meyer was no longer the agent of Frye-Bruhn Company, and therefore without authority to bind them in the purchase, they should find for the defendants.</p>
    <p id="b167-5" data-blocks='[["BL_167.6",167,[267,2015,1139,200]],["BL_168.1",168,[351,403,1142,249]]]'>Under the evidence and law as given to the jury by the court the jury may have well found that the defendant Frye-Bruhn Company and Herman Meyer were at one time co-partners, and doing business as such; that-at the time of the <a id="p144" href="#p144" data-label="144" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*144</a>purchase such copartnership had ceased to exist, and that no purchase whatever was ever made by the copartnership. The verdict in this case would meet these issues, and could not well be construed in any other way than as meeting these issues as above indicated.</p>
    <p id="b168-4" data-blocks='[["BL_168.4",168,[352,673,1151,890]]]'>But it is said by counsel for the plaintiffs that Herman Meyer admits an indebtedness, and, if this is a verdict at all, it is a verdict in favor of all the defendants, and, as it is in language only for Frye-Bruhn &amp; Co., it perhaps should not be regarded under the law as a verdict at all. While it is true that a copartnership cannot be sued in a partnership name without setting forth the names of the several copartners, and that a complaint that did not do that would be demurrable, and it is sometimes contended that a verdict' should be as complete in this respect as the pleadings in the case, or it is so uncertain in terms as to be practically valueless in determining the issues between the parties, and to be a void verdict, yet, under the liberal rules applied to the construction of verdicts, the court cannot so hold, and is of opinion that the verdict in this case can be construed to be, and was intended to be, a verdict in favor of all the defendants.</p>
    <p id="b168-5" data-blocks='[["BL_168.5",168,[348,1584,1143,630]],["BL_169.1",169,[279,407,1145,363]]]'>It is said, however, by counsel, that Herman Meyer admits his indebtedness, and for that reason the verdict would be bad as to him. It will be observed that Herman Meyer has not answered in this case; that is, no separate answer was filed by him. The general answer denies indebtedness of the copartnership. It will be remembered that the plaintiffs sued these several defendants under the claim that Frye-Bruhn Company and Herman Meyer are jointly indebted to the plaintiffs in the sum named in their complaint. Copart-ners, or the individual members of a copartnership, are not severally liable for the debts of a copartnership, unless made so by statute. Their liability is a joint, and not a several, <a id="p145" href="#p145" data-label="145" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*145</a>one. The liability being joint, and not several, it is believed that no verdict could be permitted to stand in this case against either of the defendants as a several liability. Being sued on a joint contract, to allow a verdict against either of the partners would be to establish a several liability as against such particular partner. In Kamm v. Harker, <a href="/or/3/0212-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="3 Or. 212" data-case-ids="2292573" data-case-paths="/or/3/0212-01">3 Or. 212</a>, in passing upon this question, the court says:</p>
    <blockquote id="b169-3" data-blocks='[["BL_169.4",169,[275,801,1144,625]]]'>“We often speak of a partnership firm as being the party plaintiff or defendant; but in truth a partnership does not, like a corporation, possess the power to sue and he sued. It is the individuals that compose the firm that can sue, and they only are the persons sued. I have doubts whether it is permissible, where the plaintiff sets up a joint contract made by two or more, to allow the plaintiff to proceed as if upon an individual contract made by one only. In order to amend so as to include "Welman and Peck, the plaintiff will be compelled to admit the truth of the plea as to Welman and Peck, in which ease there will be no question for the jury. If, however, the plaintiff deems it safe to amend by striking out the name of Asa Harker, he has permission to do so, and the defendant’s objection can be considered a motion for a new trial. The plaintiff withdrew his motion, and submitted to a nonsuit.”</blockquote>

It is not the individual debt of a single partner, or of one who was once a member of the partnership. This is no new doctrine of the law, and it seems unnecessary to cite authorities in support of a proposition of this kind, where they are so multitudinous. If it is true that there was and had been such a partnership as alleged in the complaint, that it is a partnership at will, that it had been dissolved by a single member of the partnership before the purchase of the meats in question, then the <a id="p146" href="#p146" data-label="146" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*146</a>purchase, or a contract to purchase, entered into by Herman Meyer in the name of the copartnership of Frye-Bruhn &amp; Co. could in no wise bind the company, and in a suit on such a joint contract no judgment could be entered as against either of the defendants, though there was a personal liability on the part of Herman Meyer to pay for the goods purchased. A judgment against Herman Meyer in this case would not .be permitted to stand.</p>
    <p id="b170-4" data-blocks='[["BL_170.4",170,[344,828,1140,462]]]'>Construing this verdict to be a verdict in favor of all the defendants, including Herman Meyer, it is plain that it answers every issue presented in this case, and is in entire harmony with the issues made by the pleadings. The instructions of the court upon the law of this case are believed to be an accurate statement of the law as applicable to the facts of the case. The judgment of the court is, therefore,- that the motion for a new trial must be overruled, and judgment entered for the defendant on the verdict.</p>
