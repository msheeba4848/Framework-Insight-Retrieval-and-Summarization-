Under the admitted facts in this case these questions arise for determination by the court: (i) Was Thorolf Kjelsberg’s placer location void because his notice of location called for a tract 1,320 feet long by 66o feet wide, while the stakes and monuments actually set by him at the corners of his claim inclosed a space described in the foregoing map 1,061 feet on the south line, 787 feet on the west line, 904 feet on the north line, and 777.7 feet on the east line? (2) <a id="p289" href="#p289" data-label="289" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*289</a>Was it void as to the excess in width over 660 feet?

(4) Was the location of the Gould or California fraction, which is conceded to be within the exterior boundaries of both the prior Kjelsberg locations, valid or void, in view of the actual possession of the ground by the prior locators with their diggings at the time of its location ?</p>

The statutory provisions relating to the length and width of lode claims in section 2320, Rev. St. U. S-, do identically that, yet in the celebrated Eureka opinion, written by Judge Field, and concurred in by Judge Sawyer, the United States Circuit Court of Nevada declared: “In the second place, the provision of the statute of 1872, requiring the lines of each claim to be parallel to each other, is merely directory, and no consequence is attached to a deviation from its direction.” By a parity of reasoning it seems fair to conclude that the rule and custom in question are each only directory, and not mandatory, and no consequence can be attached to a deviation from either of them.

Its conclusion is in direct opposition to the construction given for many years by the Land Department, and approved by every other authority having occasion to pass upon it. To gain that advantage to the miner, Congress passed the amendment of 1872, at the same time reducing the area from 160 to 20 acres, and the advantage ought not to be surrendered by construction. It is a fair inference, too, from the language used in Rosenthal v. Ives (1) that in the opinion of that court a rule or custom of miners was necessary to limit the length of placer claims to 80 rods, or 1,320 feet; and (2) that without such .a rule or custom it might be of any length or width, providing- only that the claim did not exceed 20 acres in area.
