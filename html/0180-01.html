The-first count in the information charges the defendants with, selling liquor at a certain place without a license, in violation of section 472 of the Code of Procedure of Alaska (Act-March 3, 1899, c. 429, <a href="/citations/?q=30%20Stat.%201340" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="30 Stat. 1340">30 Stat. 1340</a>).

The penalties fixed upon a conviction under these counts are, respectively, for the first, a fine of not less than $100 nor more than $2,000, or to be imprisoned for not less than two months nor more than one year; for the second, and for the first conviction, a fine of not less than $50 nor more than $200.</p>
    <p id="b205-4" data-blocks='[["BL_205.4",205,[337,885,1143,1002]]]'>The defense filed a motion to set aside the information and discharge the defendants upon the grounds: (1) That prosecutions for the crime alleged to have been committed by the defendants cannot be begun or instituted by information; that the same must be on presentment or indictment by a grand jury; that such information is contrary to the fifth amendment to the Constitution of the United States, which provides that no person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous, crime unless by presentment or indictment by a grand jury. (2) That from the records and files of said court it appears that the defendants are doing business under a barroom license granted by the authority of said court. (3) That it is not a crime, under the Code of Alaska, to remove a barroom from one building to another in the same town, camp, or settlement. {4) That the only locus mentioned in said license is Eagle City. (5) That the said information is defective, in that it is not verified by the oath'of the party making it, as made and provided by law.</p>

By section 463 of the Code of Criminal Procedure it is made necessary that a party applying for a license shall <a id="p182" href="#p182" data-label="182" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*182</a>do so by a verified petition, and it shall contain, among other statements and information, a description of “that particular place for which license is desired, designating the same by reference to street, locality, or settlement, in such manner that the exact location at which such sale of liquor is proposed may be clearly and definitely determined from the description given.” In compliance with this provision, the defendants, in their petition, alleged their “desire to procure a barroom license to engage in the sale of intoxicating liquors in the log building situated on B street in said Eagle City, known as the 'Chamber of Commerce,’ which building cost and is worth upwards of $2,000.” Before granting the license, the court heard testimony as to the character and value of the building, and, in the order granting the license, after reciting that the application was for the Chamber of Commerce building, found as a fact “that the place where applicants intend to carry on such business is a substantial building, which has cost not less than $2,000 in its construction.” This finding was rendered necessary and jurisdictional by the last clause of section 468, which provides “that no license shall be granted for the sale of liquors, at either wholesale or retail, in any other than a substantial building which shall have cost for construction not less than five hundred dollars.” Upon these representations and the order mentioned, the clerk issued a license to the defendants, who opened a saloon in the Chamber of Commerce building. According to the sworn complaint upon which the information issued, on the 3d day of June, 1901, they' removed their saloon from this substantial building, without further leave of the court, to a <em>tent </em>building situate on lot 16, block 8, which tent building cost less than $500. Section 473 provides “that any person, having obtained a license under this act, who shall violate any of its provisions, shall, upon conviction of such violation, be fined not <a id="p183" href="#p183" data-label="183" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*183</a>less than fifty dollars nor more than two hundred dollars,” etc. They are accused by the first count in the information with selling liquor at the tent building without a license, and by the second with selling in a tent building costing less than $500.</p>
    <p id="b207-3" data-blocks='[["BL_207.4",207,[344,652,1142,461]]]'>The first and important question raised by the motion is whether the crime alleged can be prosecuted by information or only by indictment. It is urged that the proceeding by information is contrary to the fifth amendment to the Constitution of the United States, and that the section of •the Alaska Code of Procedure authorizing it is void. The section thus attacked is section 474 of the Code of Procedure, contained in the act of Congress of March 3, 1899, and reads as follows: •</p>
    <blockquote id="b207-4" data-blocks='[["BL_207.5",207,[343,1152,1142,399]]]'>“Sec. 474. Procedure. That prosecutions for violations of tlie provisions of this act shall be on information filed in the District Court or any subdivision thereof, or before a United ¡States commissioner, by the United States marshal or any deputy marshal, or by the district attorney or by any of his assistants. Or such prosecution may be by and through indictment by grand jury, and it shall be the duty of either of said officers, on the representation of two or more reputable citizens, to file such information, or to present the facts alleged to constitute violations of the law to the grand jury.”</blockquote>
    <p id="b207-5" data-blocks='[["BL_207.6",207,[347,1596,1138,138]]]'>This section must be considered and construed in connection with section 3 of the same Code of Procedure, which reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b207-6" data-blocks='[["BL_207.7",207,[345,1767,1140,122]]]'>“Bee. 3. Pelonies, How Prosecuted. That no person can be tried for the commission of a felony but upon the indictment of a grand jury.”</blockquote>
    <p id="b207-7" data-blocks='[["BL_207.8",207,[347,1936,1139,140]]]'>Section 3 thus limits the scope of section 474 to the prosecution of misdemeanors by information. Section 184 of thé Criminal Code defines misdemeanors as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b207-8" data-blocks='[["BL_207.9",207,[345,2107,1140,77]],["BL_208.1",208,[323,380,1140,79]]]'>“Sec. 184. Division of Crimes. That crimes are divided into felonies and misdemeanors.

Every other crime is a misdemeanor.’1</blockquote>
    <p id="b208-4" data-blocks='[["BL_208.4",208,[327,493,1141,255]]]'>It follows, by the Code of Procedure, that no felony or crime which is or may be punishable by death or imprisonment in the penitentiary can be prosecuted by information, but that all other crimes comprising misdemeanors only, may be thus prosecuted.</p>
    <p id="b208-5" data-blocks='[["BL_208.5",208,[324,759,1144,1114]]]'>As thus limited, the inquiry is whether section 474, authorizing the prosecution of misdemeanors by information is constitutional and valid. Happily this court is not required to attempt to solve the constitutional question, or to determine whether or not there is such a question to be solved. If the District Court of Alaska may not declare an act of Congress applicable to Alaska void for supposed conflict with the Constitution of the United States, it follows that by the express provisions of section 474 misdemeanors may be prosecuted by information. If this court may test the validity of the act by the standard of the Constitution, yet the same result must follow, for the question involved in this case has been decided by the higher courts in favor of the right of the government to prosecute misdemeanors by information.

The penalty fixed by section 472 for the crime charged in the first count is a fine “not less than one hundred dollars nor more than two thousand dollars, or to be imprisoned for not less than one-month nor more than one year.” The place of imprisonment is not fixed by law, and counsel for defendants urges that it may either be in the county jail or penitentiary, at the discretion of the court.
