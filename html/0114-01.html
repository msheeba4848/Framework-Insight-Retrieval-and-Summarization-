    <blockquote id="b143-7" data-blocks='[["BL_143.7",143,[300,1316,1142,350]]]'>“Thus, the determination of the right of possession between the parties is referred to a court of competent jurisdiction in aid of the land office, but the form of action is not provided for by the statute; and apparently an action at law or a suit in equity would lie, as either might be appropriate under the particular circumstances— an action to recover possession when the plaintiff is out of possession, and a suit to quiet title when he is in possession.” Young v.

This court has ample power to pass upon all questions involved, whether at law or in equity. The suit, after it is once authorized under the provisions of section 2326, must be brought under the provisions of the Alaska Code for trying title to real estate in any other case — “an action to recover possession <a id="p120" href="#p120" data-label="120" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*120</a>when plaintiff is out of possession, and a suit to quiet title when he is in possession.”</p>

The equitable title may be litigated by one in possession under section 475, supra. An action in the nature of ejectment may be maintained under section 301 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b144-5" data-blocks='[["BL_144.5",144,[314,872,1141,260]]]'>“Any person who lias a legal estate in real property, and a present right to the possession thereof, may recover such possession, with damages for withholding the same, by an action. Such action shall be commenced against the person in the actual possession of the property at the time, or if the property be not in the actual possession of anyone, then against the person acting as the owner thereof.”</blockquote>

The publication of the notice is process, and “suits in court to settle the title are to be begun and conducted as declared in the act of Congress, which must be regarded as full and complete on that subject.” Steves v.
