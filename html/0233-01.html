Indeed, no contention is made on behalf of Mrs. Brockway that she had a right to the cabin, the only contention of counsel for the defendant being practically this: that a suit in ejectment cannot be maintained under the facts and circumstances of this case, and that the plaintiff has mistaken his remedy, if he has a remedy.</p>

That remains in the United States, and the only question presented is the priority of right to purchase the fee. Hence the inapplicability of a statute regulating generally actions for the recovery of real estate, in which actions different kinds of title may be sufficient to sustain the right of recovery.

If, in addition to the survey, application is properly and lawfully made to the United States for a grant of the land by letters patent, and all the proceedings are regular in that behalf, showing a bona fide purpose to acquire the title from the United States, and a man goes and settles upon a lot under such circumstances, claiming the same, and putting improvements .thereon, such as a cabin, etc., he would thereby evidence his purpose to acquire a title ultimately to said land, when a patent should be regularly granted by the United States; and he might, perhaps, under such circumstances, acquire such title of possession as to enable him to maintain this suit. Or,, if he marked the boundaries of his lot by substantial posts set in the ground at the corners, or fenced a lot of ground' upon the public domain, and thereby reduced it to possession,, and kept the fences or other evidence of description in repair, so that his possession remains continuous, he might maintain his right of possession of the ground so inclosed <a id="p238" href="#p238" data-label="238" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*238</a>as against all save and except the United States, and might, if his possession were disturbed by another, bring suit in ■ejectment to recover the same.</p>
