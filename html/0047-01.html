Rev. St. U. S. § 850 [U. S. Comp. St. 1901, p. 655]. It is claimed on the part of the government, and appears from the statement of differences or disallowances made by the accounting officers of the Treasury Department, that these parties were officers of the United States, drawing salaries from the government; said States being United States commissioner at Juneau, Alaska; Staples, deputy United States marshal, Barnett, second lieutenant of marines; Webster,, assistant paymaster U. S. N.; Wyman, acting assistant surgeon M. H. S.; Wilson, past assistant surgeon U. S. N.; Jackson, general agent of education; and Brady, United States commissioner at Sitka; and that no mileage or other compensation in addition to their salaries should have been allowed. Assuming these facts, to be true — and I take it that all the allegations contained in the statements of differences <a id="p52" href="#p52" data-label="52" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*52</a>or disallowances not controverted by direct evidence are admitted by the defendants to be true — there was an undoubted etror on the part of the judge of the court <em>in </em>ordering the-payments complained of. But the law further provides that in cases where the United States are parties the marshal' shall, on the order of the court, to be entered on its minutes,, pay to the jurors and witnesses all the fees to which they appear by such order to be entitled, which sum shall be allowed him at the treasury in his accounts. Rev. St. U., S. §' 855 [U. S. Comp. St. 1901, p. 657]. Also, “that no accounts of fees or-costs paid to any witness or juror, upon the order of any judge or commissioner, shall be so re-examined as to charge any marshal for an erroneous taxation of such fees or costs.” Rev. St* U. S. § 846 [U. S. Comp. St. 1901, p. 647]. By orders of the court, entered upon its minutes, these witnesses were directed to be paid for their attendance and mileage, as witnesses on behalf of the United States, the respective sums named above, and were so paid under such orders by the marshal. These payments were not subject to re-examination by the Treasury Department. Harmon v. U. S. (C. C.) <a href="/f/43/0560-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="43 F. 560" data-case-ids="3726087" data-case-paths="/f/43/0560-01">43 Fed. 560</a>.</p>

The first item in this account disallowed by the accounting officers is the payment to Thomas E. McFarland of the sum of $49.95 for provisions, medicine, transportation of prisoners, servant and nurse for prisoners, etc. The testimony of Adolph A. Meyer, United States deputy marshal, on the part of the defense, shows that the jail at Sitka had not, at the time of this payment, .been turned over to the mar-' shal, but was in charge of the United States navy; that one of the prisoners in the marshal’s custody was suffering from a loathsome disease, and had been ordered by the physician in attendance upon the prisoners to be taken to the hot springs, some miles from Sitka, and renowned for their curative properties in the treatment of such ailments; that the prisoner was taken there by a guard, nurse, and an Indian attendant, and remained there for a considerable time; that the place was uninhabited; that there were no means of procuring food or supplies at the springs, and no means of access to them, except by water, and all provisions had to be taken from Sitka; that the bill of this trip was necessarily incurred, and that the prices charged were reasonable. I mention this testimony simply to show that the expenses were incurred to meet such an emergency or a contingency <a id="p54" href="#p54" data-label="54" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*54</a>as a marshal, having charge of the lives and health of the prisoners, should be at all times ready, willing, and able to meet, and, in meeting, should be sustained by the government.

The rate charged was $i per day, of which only 75 cents per day are allowed, the amount of disallowance by the department being $15.25. It has also disallowed a portion of the bill of Dr. H. S. Wyman for professional services rendered United States prisoners confined in jail at Sitka, where-1 in the charge was $5 per visit and $3 in each case for medicines. These amounts are arbitrarily reduced by the accounting officers to $2 per visit, and nothing whatever is allowed by them for medicines. The disallowance by the accounting officer was made because the charge was deemed excessive, and amounts to $57. No evidence whatever has been produced to show that the charges mentioned in the last two bills were excessive or improper, or not actually paid in good faith, nor is there any claim of fraudulent collusion. In the absence of a showing of fraud or mistake, I cannot inquire into the reasonableness of these charges. The marshal, as disbursing officer, must necessarily be allowed a proper discretion in securing necessary medical services and in purchasing medicines and-provisions for his prisoners, as well as in many other matters of disbursement of public funds in his hands. To permit the accounting officers at Washington, who, from the nature of the case, could know little, if anything, of the reasonableness of charges, or of the possible necessity for paying what might be demanded or of going without, or, indeed, of any of the circumstances surrounding each case, thus arbitrarily to question or deny the value of the services while admitting their necessity, would be to ap<a id="p55" href="#p55" data-label="55" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*55</a>ply to this remote territory a very harsh and unjust rule, with possibly very dangerous results to the community at large. If the accounting officers have the right to reduce a fee approved by the court, they may with equal right and propriety increase it. I do not consider that they have the power to review or reverse disbursements made in the discretion of the marshal, who is charged with the duty of expending public moneys, especially when those disbursements have pass.ed the scrutiny and received the sanction of a judicial officer charged with the examination of them.

Other bills incurred for furniture for the same purpose at about the same time, and paid by the marshal, amounting to over $500, were not questioned by the accounting officers. The testimony of Mr. Meyer shows that this particular set of furniture was actually supplied. The only ground for disallowance is that its purchase was not authorized.

Under the organic act, a deputy mar-shall, in addition to the usual fees of constables in Oregon, received a salary from the government. The fees of constables in Oregon are prescribed in the General Daws of Oregon (page 604), and allow for attending a justice’s court during a trial therein, 50 cents per day. The deputy attended the Commissioner’s Court in the capacity of constable, and could only receive a constable’s fees. This charge is, therefore, excessive, and must be reduced by the disallowance of $1.50 per day, amounting to $12. Disallowance No. 4 was on the ground that for three of these da)^s charged for as constable he was also paid the sum of $6 for services as bailiff of the District Court. It would make no difference if he had been so paid, or if he had acted as bailiff, for he was not entitled to receive fees for his services as bailiff, and the services as bailiff did not necessarily interfere with the services as constable.

That in actions of this character, the burden of proof to sustain its allegation of the misappropriation of public funds rests with the government. That the marshal is bound to obey the order of the court for the payment of fees to jurors and witnesses; and his accounts of fees and costs paid under said order to such jurors and witnesses, even though they be officers of the United States, cannot be sore-examined by the accounting officers of the treasury as to-charge him with erroneous taxation, but the payments must be allowed him in his account. That the marshal of the District of Alaska is entitled to receive the fees of office established by law as payable to other United States marshals, to be paid to him on settling his accounts at the treasury. That actual and necessary payments by court officials for their board and lodging, while attending a session of court in a place other than their official residence,, are properly a part of their “actual necessary expenses when traveling in the discharge of their official duties,” as those W'ords are used in the organic act. That deputy marshals of Alaska are not, under the organic act, entitled as such to per diem or pay when acting as constables, other than such as is allowed to constables under the laws of Oregon. That the power to retain and employ attorneys and counselors for the government rests solely with the Attorney General of the United States.</p>

Its offices remote from Washington, and, indeed, from civilization, were shut off from any immediate communication with the department, and precedents were in most cases wholly wanting. It was difficult, and often impossible, to follow the ambiguous organic act, and to reconcile the innumerable conflicts and discrepancies between the laws of the United States and the statutes of Oregon by that act made applicable to the territory. Under the circumstances, if the defendants are to be held liable, under the necessarily rigid rules of the Treasury Department, for the errors of the late marshal, many of which, if he had lived, might have been corrected, it can justly be said that his accounts were kept and rendered honestly and in good faith.</p>
