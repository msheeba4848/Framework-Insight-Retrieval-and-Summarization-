It further appears from the findings of the court that the railroad company made payment in full for the land September 10, 1856, and received at that time the certificate -of the register of the land office. The approval of this entry for the issue of a patent was made at the General Land Office in Washington, June 1, 1874.

On the trial of the case in the lower court the defendants endeavored to show that they acquired through certain legal proceedings the equitable title to the land, upon which they could defend against the patent under the practice which prevailed in Missouri. The case was tried several times in the courts of Missouri,, and at the last trial the Supreme Court of Missouri recognized the fact that the legal title remained in the United States until the patent issued, and that the location title gave an equitable right that had been conveyed, upon which an action was sustainable in the state courts by virtue of the state-statutes.

The defendants in this ease were strangers to that party and to his equitable claim, or equitable title, as it is termed, not connecting themselves with it by any valid transfer from the original or any subsequent holder. The statute of limitations of Missouri did not operate to convey that claim or equitable title to them.

For the enforcement of equitable rights, however clear, distinct equitable proceedings must be instituted. The patent is the instrument which, under the laws of Congress, passes the title of the United States. It is the government conveyance. If other parties possess equities superior to those of the patentee, upon which the patent issued, a court of equity will, upon proper proceedings, enforce such equities by compelling a transfer of the legal title, or enjoining its enforcement, or canceling the patent. But in the action of ejectment in the federal courts the legal title must prevail, and the patent, when regular on its face, is conclusive evidence of that title. * * In several of the states — and such is the case in Missouri— equities of the character mentioned, instead of being presented in a separate suit, may be set up as a defense to the action of ejectment.

The pre-emptor acquires no legal title until the patent issues; and his equity, even after payment, has been held not to be of so important a character as to prevent the Department of the Interior from setting it aside on its own motion, and thereby absolutely destroying all of such claimed equities as were supposed to have vested in the pre-emptor. The citizen taking a homestead on the public domain acquires no legal title to his land until he has made final proof of five' years’ residence, improvements, etc. No part of the land covered by the homestead claim could be entered by another, either by pre-emption or homestead, or otherwise, until the first entry or homestead claim had been contested and set aside by action of the department; but the entryman acquires no legal right until the issuance of the patent upon final proof.</p>

If possession were sufficient title to enable the party to maintain the action of ejectment where it is said one must have a legal interest or title, surely' the words “seised or possessed” must be construed to have at least as broad a meaning when used in this statute of limitations, and a party in possession of real property, whose possession had been intruded upon by others, could, at any time within 10 years, bring his action to dispossess them. Can we say that parties who have gone into possession of land and have maintained the possession thereof for a number of years must have a higher or better title, in order to plead the statute of limitations, than a plaintiff who seeks to recover on the strength of his own title, possession having been declared sufficient for that purpose not only by our own court, but approved by the Supreme Court of the United States? If there could be any further question as to the quality of title that.would enable these defendants to plead the statute of limitations, it would seem to be put entirely at rest by section 1042 of our Code (Act June 6, 1900, c. 786, <a href="/citations/?q=31%20Stat.%20493" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="31 Stat. 493">31 Stat. 493</a>), which provides for a shorter period of time where the quality of title is higher than mere possession.

The proviso to the 10-years statute I have before quoted at length. Of course, this claim is made under the proviso to section 4 as quoted. It is a little difficult to determine what meaning, if <a id="p459" href="#p459" data-label="459" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*459</a>any, this proviso has; and, in order to ascertain it, it becomes necessary to inquire into the history of the legislation in <em>Oregon </em>that has been followed by the Congress of the United States in legislating for Alaska. The statute of Oregon at one time provided a limitation for bringing actions for the recovery of real estate at 20 years. In 1876 a statute was passed by the same Legislature, of which the present statute of limitations for Alaska is an exact copy, and contains the same proviso found in section 4 of our Civil Code. The object and purpose of the Oregon Legislature is clear so far as the proviso was concerned at the time of its adoption. Some rights might be cut off by the new statute of 10 years, and therefore the-provision that “in all cases where a cause of action has already accrued and the period prescribed in this section within which an action may be brought has expired, or will expire within one year from the approval of this act, an action may be brought on such cause of action within one year of the date of the approval of this act.” But this identical statute has been in force and effect in Alaska since the 17th day of May, 1884, and is the only limitation ever fixed by law within this jurisdiction for the recovery of real property. It would seem, therefore, that the proviso attached to section 4 of the act of June 6, 1900, was a mere reiteration and adoption of the old Oregon statute, and it can have no possible meaning or effect as applied to conditions in Alaska at the time of the passage of the act of June 6, 1900. Therefore the 10 years fixed by the statute can only be invoked by the plaintiff as the term within which his action may be brought, in order to divest the defendants of their possession or right of possession.</p>

While these declarations are undoubtedly accurate in many respects, are they in all? A man who had been permitted by the locator, prior to patent, to occupy some portion of the surface land, even for a consideration, could not appear before the register and receiver and file an adverse to the claim made by the party proceeding to obtain patent. The right to adverse is saved to those having an adverse title or claim to the mineral lands or the mining claim as a mining claim, and not to mere occupiers of the surface soil, or some small portion of it. If the court is right upon this proposition, then the person occupying such surface ground could have no opportunity of meeting the claims of the owners of the mine, either at the time of the proceedings for patent, or any time prior thereto or thereafter, until the owner of the mining claim sought to dispossess him by proper proceedings.</p>

In other words, I hold that in pleading the statute of limitations it may reach back to the date of location, or as soon thereafter as the defendant acquires an interest, and begins to run from that date.</p>
    <p id="b491-3" data-blocks='[["BL_491.4",491,[146,1643,1144,245]]]'>It is believed that the pleadings and agreed facts in this case are sufficient to sustain the conclusion arrived at on the ground of estoppel, and I think it needs no discussion to show that the principle of estoppel may be invoked in support of the decision here made.</p>
    <p id="b491-4" data-blocks='[["BL_491.5",491,[146,1910,1143,307]],["BL_492.1",492,[291,388,1148,418]]]'>I reach this conclusion with a great deal of deference, after such hurried examination as I have been able to make of the question while being pressed by the continuous duties of a trial court. I know that the mining company against which this decision goes is amply able to take an appeal, and present this question to a higher court. This fact makes me less <a id="p468" href="#p468" data-label="468" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*468</a>guarded, and I reach the conclusion, as above stated, with less hesitation because of such right of appeal, and because I know the question will be examined by men of greater learning and broader experience than mine, and no doubt with a clearer insight than I possess. Should the appellate-court take a different view of the law upon this question, no-one will hail its decision with greater delight than myself, and no one be more ready to enforce the conclusion it reaches.</p>
