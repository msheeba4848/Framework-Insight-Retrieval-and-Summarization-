To this order the defendant answered, alleging that as a <a id="p303" href="#p303" data-label="303" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*303</a>member of the firm of Milroy, Hannum &amp; Milroy he did receive the money in question; that theretofore the firm had been employed by the defendant in two suits; and that, for the various services rendered in those two suits, mentioned in the answer, the plaintiff in this action became indebted to the firm in the sum of about $1,250; and that the money received by him was applied on the payment of the sums due from Mrs. Nodine to the firm, and the defendant set up his attorney’s lien upon the property.</p>

Upon the pleadings the court heard the testimony of both the plaintiff and the defendant in full, and has examined the records in both the suits mentioned in the defendant’s answer. From all the evidence in the case the court is now satisfied that there has been no misconduct on the part of the defendant; that his refusal to deliver the money obtained by him in the course of his professional employment was in accordance with the rule of law as laid down by statute. Whether or not the defendant is entitled to charge for the services the sum which he did charge, and which he did retain from the funds in his hands, is not now a matter for this court to determine. The only question which the court now intends to determine is that the defendant acted in good faith, and without any misconduct or fraudulent intent upon his part. Every phase of this case is determined in favor of the defendant in the case determined by the Supreme Court of the United States entitled In re Paschal, <a href="/us/77/0483-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="10 Wall. 483" data-case-ids="3435720" data-case-paths="/us/77/0483-01">10 Wall. 483</a>, <a href="/us/77/0483-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="10 Wall. 483" data-case-ids="3435720" data-case-paths="/us/77/0483-01">19 L.

It is a question to be determined by a jury, and the court will order .that the matter be referred to a jury for determination. However, it is unfair to the defendant to single him out of the firm, and prosecute the case against him alone. He acted for and on account of the firm, and the firm is the real party in interest, and not the defendant. There will be a further order that the firm be' substituted as defendant, instead of C. S. Hannum alone. The cause will then be placed upon the trial calendar for determination by a jury upon the pleadings as they now stand between the plaintiff and the defendant in this action.</p>
