Woodruff, being indebted to the Ames Mercantile Company, made their note to that company for the sum of $1,514.90, due 120 days from date. To secure the payment of the note, on the same date they made a mortgage in the name of F. H. Ames, as manager of the company, upon certain mining property,, among others No. 2 above discovery on Bonanza creek. The mortgage is upon an undivided one-half interest in the property, that being all the interest owned by the makers of the note, the other half interest belonging to Julius Nelson. The note not being paid, a suit was brought by the plaintiff to foreclose the mortgage. The makers of the note, as well as Nelson and other parties laboring-upon the claim, are made defendants, and the plaintiff asks for an injunction to restrain all of the defendants from working upon the claim-pending the litigation. Kruzner and Woodruff appear by their attorney, and by affidavits make known to the court that at the time the note in question was made the Ames Mercantile Company was a foreign corporation doing business in Alaska, and that it had not complied with the statute requiring the filing of a copy of its articles of incorporation, a statement of its assets, and the consent to be sued within the district as provided by law. It elects to make void .its-obligation under the statute, and objects to the enforcement of the rights of the plaintiff against it.
