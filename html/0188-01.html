The court held at that time that the complainants, bjr use and occupation of the lands described, had acquired no rights by prescription in the tide lands described, that the right of fishery in the deep waters and upon the tide flats along the Tongass Narrows on either side of Ketchi-kan creek was a common one, and that the parties to this suit were equally entitled to take fish in said waters, so long, at least, as neither party interfered with the other in the exercise of such rights of fishery; and, if the complainants were the owners in fee of the uplands claimed by the respondents their littoral rights would give them no control over the tide lands for the purpose of fishing ordinarily. But the court also held that the owners of the uplands which bordered upon the tide waters of Tongass Narrows had certain littoral rights, which at least gave them a right of way from their upland holdings to the deep waters of the sea for purposes of fishing or navigation.</p>

But, after admitting this, it is evident to the court that such admission does not aid the respondents in this action. Riparian rights and littoral rights are practically one and the same; certainly the same in principle. The word “riparian” is derived from the Batin “ripa,” a river bank, and is used to describe the rights of owners of uplands along running streams or rivers. The word “littoral” is derived from the Batin Titus,” the seashore, and is used— and properly so — in describing the rights of the upland owners along the seashore and tide lands. But, as before stated, the principle that controls largely the exercise of riparian and littoral rights is the same, and the authorities upon the rights of the riparian owner apply with equal force to the littoral rights of the owner of the uplands.</p>

In a navigable river the right of navigation would intervene, and prevent this being done. The rights actually exercised by the proprietors of land on the shores of tide water are often dissimilar to those enjoyed by proprietors' above the flow of the tide, since salt water is less available in the arts or for irrigation than fresh; but a littoral proprietor, like a riparian proprietor, has a right to the water frontage belonging by nature to his land, although the only practical advantage of it may- consist in the access thereby afforded him to the water for the purpose of using the right of navigation. This right of access is his only, and exists by virtue and in respect of his riparian property. It exists in the case of tide waters, even when the shore is the sovereign’s property, both when the tide is out and when it is in. It is distinct from the public right of navigation and an interruption of it is an encroachment upon a private right, whether caused by a public nuisance or authorized by the Legislature.”</blockquote>

It is also settled by high, authority that the right to take fish in the waters of the sea, and even along the tide, flats, is one common to all of the citizens. In what, then, are the property rights of the littoral owner greater or more sacred than the common right of all the citizens to take fish? The right of the littoral owner to construct a wharf in front of his land is unquestioned, and it is clear that by such construction he deprives-all others of the right to fish or in any other way to occupy the ground covered by his wharf. It is a matter of common information that driving piles and the construction of wharves thereon make the taking of fish beneath the wharf practically impossible. Are we to say, then, that the littoral owner’s right of way across the tide flats to deep water permits him to occupy the tide flats with his wharf, whereby the right of fishery is made impossible, and yet that by cleaning the flats from débris and other material that gathers thereon, and making them practical for- the use of his nets and for the purpose of drawing them across the same and landing the fish upon the uplands he acquires no higher or better right in this behalf than that which inures in common to all citizens — to fish and.navigate the seas and rivers of our country? It is believed that the principle which gives the littoral owner the right of way and the right <a id="p197" href="#p197" data-label="197" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*197</a>to construct a wharf in front of his upland across the tide flats to the deep water may be also as clearly and reasonably applied to a right of way that shall permit the littoral owner to exercise certain possessory rights as a right' of way to the deep water of the sea over the tide flats, and that he may acquire certain possessory rights in such right of way by cleaning away the débris and material deposited thereon, and making it a clear and proper roadway from the deep water to the upland, over which he may pass and re-pass with his nets in the act of fishing, unobstructed and uninterrupted by the acts or appliances of those who have a common right to fish in the waters of the sea and the rivers of Alaska.</p>

A reasonable right of way to deep water for the purpose of setting and bringing in these nets to the high land would certainly seem to be not less in width than the shortest nets used, viz., 600 feet, and that, in going over this right of way to and from the upland the complainants should not be impeded or obstructed by any others who may have the common rights of fishery at this point. The possessory rights exercised over this right of way by the littoral owners in cleaning the débris, stumps, timber, brush, and stones therefrom gives the complainants as clear a right thereto as if the same was covered by a wharf. It is not intended that this right of way shall give the complainants exclusive rights of fishery upon the tide flats, but it is intended that in pursuing their vocation in taking fish from the deep waters or along the tide flats in going and returning to and from their upland holdings they shall be in no wise interfered with or hindered by other fishermen. It seems clear to the court that to this extent the property rights of the littoral owners <a id="p198" href="#p198" data-label="198" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*198</a>must be protected by law, and that, as in the case of the construction of a wharf, any interference with the right of the littoral owner, or any interference with the littoral rights by the upland owner, may be prevented by the restraining order and injunction issued from this court.</p>

S. Comp. St. 1901, p. 1469], gives all persons ingress and egress on the waters of all streams, whether navigable or otherwise. It is even claimed that every upland claim is subject to this servitude. The section referred to contains the following provisions:</p>

    <p id="b222-6" data-blocks='[["BL_222.6",222,[313,1836,1142,255]]]'>Without discussing the meaning of the section referred to, it is sufficient to say it has no application to the question now before the court, and, even if it had, it would not give the public generally the right to cross the upland holdings or the uplands held and patented by the United States to its citizens.</p>
    <p id="b222-7" data-blocks='[["BL_222.7",222,[314,2103,1140,96]],["BL_223.1",223,[202,383,1140,139]]]'>The rights of the complainants in this case are determined by'the act of Congress approved May 17, 1884 (<a href="/citations/?q=23%20Stat.%2024" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="23 Stat. 24">23 Stat. 24</a>, <a id="p199" href="#p199" data-label="199" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*199</a>c. 53)- Section 8 of said act, or that part thereof more particularly applicable to the case under discussion, reads as follows:</p>

    <p id="b223-5" data-blocks='[["BL_223.5",223,[203,810,1140,737]]]'>The words “lands actually in their use or occupation, or now claimed by them,” are very broad, and would, perhaps, permit persons to claim any extent of territory, or would permit Indians to claim any extent of territory, and to convey their said possessory claim or right to others. If their claim or possessory right was a valuable one, it would be one that might be conveyed to others; and if, under this act, the Indian Charles Dickson was claiming any particular tract of land at the time said act of Congress was approved, he could convey his possessory right and interest in and to such claim to others, who might continue to occupy and possess-the same and use the same thereafter, or who might continue to exercise the same possessory rights over the land as had been exercised by the native Indian Charles Dickson.</p>
    <p id="b223-6" data-blocks='[["BL_223.6",223,[204,1558,1141,630]],["BL_224.1",224,[314,384,1142,1698]]]'>The evidence in this case tends to show that the Indian Charles Dickson did occupy certain lands bordering on the tide waters of Tongass Narrows in Alaska, and at the mouth of the Ketchikan river or creek, on the 17th day of May, 1884, and had used, occupied, and claimed the same for fishing purposes for a long period prior thereto; and it is equally apparent from the testimony in this case that the Indian Charles Dickson did not claim and did not use for any purpose the whole of the 160 acres described in the deed made and executed by Dickson to A. W. Berry. This was an effort evidently made by the white man, or a scheme entered into by Mr. Berry, and perhaps others, to secure, under the <a id="p200" href="#p200" data-label="200" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*200</a>act referred to, a possessory claim or title to much more land than ever had been claimed or used by the Indian Dickson. This deed by Dickson, while perhaps not acknowledged in accordance with the statute, was a-good common-law deed, and conveyed all the right, interest, claim, and possession held by the -Indian Dickson at the time of the passage of said act of Congress, and at the time the deed conveying the title to Berry was signed. This deed conveyed his posses-sory rights and his fishing rights, whatever they were, in and about the mouth of Ketchikan creek. It gave Berry the right to such uplands as were occupied by him on the said tide waters, in which he and his grantees were and should be protected under the act of Congress, to the same extent that they would -be under a patent, until the Congress of the United States shall otherwise legislate. The rights of the Indian and the rights of Berry and his grantees were fixed and determined under the act of 1884, and not by subsequent legislation referred to by defendants in their brief. It is believed that the language used in the act of Congress of May 17, 1884, “used or occupied,” limits the following words, “or claimed by them,” used in the same connection. Clearly, Congress never intended that an Indian or white man might say to his neighbors, “I claim a hundred thousand acres, or a million acres, or any other amount of land, between certain boundaries or natural landmarks, as my individual property,” and that such a claim would be protected by said acts, and made sacred to the rights of the claimant as a property right. Undoubtedly, Congress did intend by the act to protect possessory rights, and to protect the rights of possession of those who were actually in the use and occupation of any particular scope or section of land without reference to the acreage thereof.</p>
    <p id="b224-4" data-blocks='[["BL_224.4",224,[315,2095,1138,94]],["BL_225.1",225,[190,389,1147,1260]]]'>I conclude, therefore, from the testimony in this case, although the same is very general, that the Indian Dickson <a id="p201" href="#p201" data-label="201" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*201</a>•did use and occupy a few acres of land bordering upon the tide waters of Tongass Narrows, in and about the mouth ■of Ketchikan creek, that were held and used by him in fishing and taking salmon at that point; that certainly the land used and occupied by him would at least be equal to the 600 feet in width of ground by the court given as a right •of way to the deep water — that is, the Indian occupied at ■least 300 feet on either side of Ketchikan creek, at or near the mouth thereof, where the creek empties into the tide waters of Tongass Narrows; that the grantees of said Dick•son, these plaintiffs, have a possessory right to so much of said land, at least, in which they should be protected by •said act of 1884, and such other lands as the said grantors have held actual possession of, and have reduced to actual use and occupancy, since said conveyance was made. Considering all the testimony in said case, the court can find no good reason for changing the views before expressed in this •case on the hearing for a temporary restraining order. It follows, therefore, that a permanent injunction will be grant•ed to the complainants in this case to restrain all interference with their right of ingress and egress to the uplands in and about the mouth of Ketchikan creek and on the tide flats of Tongass Narrows to the extent of 600 feet — 300 •feet on each side of said creek.</p>
