Code, p. 367, Carter (a re-enactment of the Oregon Code in force at the time of the agreement in question), joint tenancy is abolished, and all persons having an undivided interest in real property are to be deemed and considered tenants in common. The parties to the agreement of April 26,1898, if at all interested in the Anny claim, were co-tenants, and not mining partners. Sections 788 and 796, 2 Findley on Mines. Real property descends directly to the heir upon the death of the ancestor '‘subject to his debts.” Section 168, Civ. Code, p. 384, Carter. The heir obtains title by descent, and not through the process of the probate court. His title vests immediately upon the death of the ancestor, and the only jurisdiction through probate lies to enforce the lien of the ancestor’s debts against the real property. If there are no debts, the heir becomes vested at once with a complete title. Lohmann v. Helmer (C. C.) <a href="/f/104/0178-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="104 F. 178" data-case-ids="6720558" data-case-paths="/f/104/0178-01">104 Fed. 178</a>. If the ancestor was a co-tenant, the heir stands in his place. Speer’s sale of an undivided half interest was valid, and Marcy became, a co-tenant in the mine. A tenant in common may maintain an action for the recovery of a mining claim without joining his co-tenant. Morenhaut v.

    <p id="b536-6" data-blocks='[["BL_536.6",536,[309,884,1153,1272]]]'>This is an action by the plaintiffs, as partners with Samuel Henninger, one of the defendants, to recover their alleged partnership interests in a mining claim located by the defendant, and described in the complaint. It appears that the defendant Henninger, together with Binswanger and others of the plaintiffs, entered into a written agreement of partnership on the 26th day of April, 1898, for the purpose of-prospecting for mines, both placer and quartz, in Alaska, from that date until the 1st day of October, 1899. The complaint sets out the contract, and alleges that it was recorded on the 4th day of October, 1900, in the commissioner’s office in Nome; that, in pursuance of the contract, the parties all came to Alaska, and engaged in the business described in their articles of copartnership; that on July 7, 1899, the defendant Henninger located the mine in question in his own name; that he remained in possession of it until about July 5, 1901, when he sold the same to the other defendants in this action, except the Alaska Banking &amp; Safe Deposit Company, in whose hands the deed from Henninger to the other defendants was placed in escrow. The plaintiffs allege their interest in the property under their articles of copartnership, and the insolvency of the defendants, and then ask for a judgment that they be decreed to be the owners of the interests to which they would be entitled in their articles of copartnership.-</p>

The reply is a denial of all the material allegations of the answer.</p>
    <p id="b537-4" data-blocks='[["BL_537.4",537,[116,893,1144,1268]]]'>An application was made by the defendants for a continuance, and the affidavit filed in support thereof alleged that Henninger and Collins, two of the partners, were without the District of Alaska, and sets out that, if they were present, they would testify to the facts alleged in the answer, to wit, to the dissolution and settlement of all partnership affairs prior to the location by Henninger on July 7, 1899. Rather than permit a continuance in the case, the plaintiffs admitted that those two partners would so testify if present, and the court denied the continuance, upon the agreement that the affidavit should stand as their evidence in the case. Upon the trial, Binswanger and Coburn, two of- the partners, testified and denied positively that there was any such settlement or dissolution of the partnership property in question. The testimony of Collins and Henninger, taken in the matter of the estate of Albert Speer and A. J. Lawrence, two of the partners, who were drowned off the Alaskan coast, was introduced in evidence by consent. The articles of copartnership in this case are particularly against the defendants. The first clause, after naming the parties, continues: “Agree to and do hereby become partners in the business of prospecting for mines, both placer and quartz, in Alaska, from this date until the first day of October, 1899/'' The next clause in relation to this particular branch of inquiry reads as follows:</p>

It seems to the court to put the burden of' proof upon Henninger. He must convince the court, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the copartnership is dissolved, as alleged by him, for he admits the making and signing of the articles of copartnership. I am satisfied, from all the evidence in the case, that he has failed to do that. The plaintiffs made a prima facie case by alleging and proving the articles of copartnership and the location of the mine within the life of the agreement. Two of the partners, as witnesses, testified that the' agreement was dissolved; two other partners, as witnesses, deny the dissolution. I am satisfied, from all the evidence and from Hen-ninger’s management of their boat and other property, and the fact that he sold the schooner and kept the proceeds, and that they held certain meetings at which he was present, that there was no agreed dissolution of this copartnership prior to the location of the claim by Henninger. It is probably true that there were dissensions among the partners, and I am inclined to believe that these difficulties arose very largely from Henninger’s management, which evidently was not satisfactory to his copartners, for they afterwards removed him before the end of the copartnership.</p>
