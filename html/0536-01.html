Roberts, to recover the value of a ring said to have been unlawfully and improperly appropriated to his own use by the said Roberts after the same had been lent to him by the plaintiff on the promise of said Roberts to return the same. Upon an affidavit filed with the complaint, an order of arrest was issued, and placed in the hands of Deputy United States Marshal W. S. Staley for service. It seems that Roberts was passing through Juneau on Sunday, August 25, 1901, and was found by the deputy marshal at that time, and, under the order of arrest issued by the commissioner’s court, seems to have been taken into custody by the deputy marshal on said 25th day of August; - that thereafter, and on the same day, the defendant gave bond for his appearance, and delivered the same to the marshal, and the said deputy marshal thereupon made return of the said writ or order of arrest on the said 25th day of August, 1901, the same being Sunday. The defendant, by his counsel, appearing in said commissioner’s court specially and for the purposes of the action only, moved for the dismissal of the action on the ground that the defendant had been improperly arrested on a Sunday; that the court had no jurisdiction for that reason; that the said summons had been served on the same day — which also appears from the records and files of the case. The court below overruled the motions and held the defendant to answer, whereupon the defendant answered, making a general denial of all the facts set up and alleged in plaintiff’s complaint, pleading specially that he had been arrested on a Sunday over his protest, that the same was a nonjudicial day, and that he was not, therefore, subject <a id="p538" href="#p538" data-label="538" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*538</a>to arrest on civil process, and that the court was without jurisdiction; also that the summons had been served on a Sunday, and was therefore void. It is further alleged affirmatively in the answer that the jewel referred to in the plaintiff’s complaint was presented to him by the plaintiff, and that there was no understanding or agreement that the defendant should ever return the same. On this issue, the defendant not being personally in court to testify, the plaintiff recovered judgment in the lower court, and the defendant appeals therefrom <em>to </em>this court.</p>

On the other hand, it is contended on behalf of the appellant that the action of the deputy marshal in making said arrest on Sunday was illegal and void; that the service of the summons was illegal and void; that the taking of the bond was an illegal proceeding; and that in <a id="p539" href="#p539" data-label="539" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*539</a>fact everything that was done by the deputy marshal in this behalf was, in law, void and of no force or effect.</p>

The motion raises the entire issue on the face of the case as made in the court below. The court therefore is compelled to examine the law as to what may or may not be done legally and properly on Sunday. And first, let us examine our statutes on the question. Section 141 of the Criminal Code of Alaska (Act March 3, 1899, c. 429, <a href="/citations/?q=30%20Stat.%201274" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="30 Stat. 1274">30 Stat. 1274</a>) reads as follows:</p>

    <p id="b564-6" data-blocks='[["BL_564.6",564,[317,946,1147,1061]]]'>It will be observed that the criminal statute referred to can hardly be construed as including the action of a marshal who serves process on a Sunday. The section of the Civil Code also leaves the matter in very grave doubt. This Code seems wholly to refer to the action of the court, unless the words, "nor can any judicial business be transacted on a Sunday or legal holiday,” etc., should be deemed to include the action ■of a marshal in serving process or taking bail bond. It is contended, however, on the part of the defendant (the contention being earnestly and ably resisted by counsel for the plaintiff), that the common law which is in force in the District of Alaska makes the action of the deputy marshal in this instance unlawful and void, and that while it is perhaps doubtful whether the language of our statute is sufficient to include the return of the service of process in the words “judicial business,” as used in our statute, yet the common law clearly and unequivocally helps out the statutory provisions, and covers the objection made on behalf of the defendant. Section 367 of our Code of Civil Procedure (Act June 6, 1900, c. 786, <a href="/citations/?q=31%20Stat.%20552" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="31 Stat. 552">31 Stat. 552</a>) reads as follows:</p>

In Massachusetts it is held that whatever of the common law was brought over by the colonists, such statutes as have been passed since the immigration in aid of the common law and adopted in practice, and such usages as probably originated from laws of the Colonial Legislature, constitute the common law of Massachusetts, except as changed by statute.

The common law, as before stated, is said to be an unwritten law. It is classed by Blackstone as the lex non scripta. Another definition is, “The common law of England meant all of those universal rules, not the enactment of Parliament, which govern the English people.” In Andrews’ American Eaw, § 200, the author says:</p>

In other states a particular date is fixed, and the common law includes all the statutes up to that particular date. In Virginia the common law and the statutes in aid thereof prior to the fourth year of King James I were adopted as the common law of Virginia. Some other states fix the date to include all of the common law and the statutes in aid thereof prior to the Declaration of Independence. It is also said that, if no other definite period is fixed, the Declaration of Independence necessarily limits the period when the common law of England was a part of the law of the colonies. See Andrews’ American Eaw, p. 249, and authorities there cited. Perhaps the varying decisions which we find bearing upon the question at bar are due <a id="p543" href="#p543" data-label="543" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*543</a>in a measure to the dates fixed adopting the common law and the statutes of England.

Having done so, and by neglect to move to be discharged, he consented to the process, aiid waived all irregularity in the manner of its issue. The language of the court, it will be observed, is “that the plaintiff appeared and put in bail. Having done so, and by neglect to move to be discharged, he consented to the process,” etc., and thereby waived irregularities ; showing conclusively that if in that case the defendant, notwithstanding the fact he put in bail, had moved for <a id="p550" href="#p550" data-label="550" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*550</a>a discharge because of the irregularities in the manner of the issuance and service of the process, he would have been so discharged notwithstanding the bail. But let it be remembered, also, that in that case, where there was no motion to discharge, and the party put in bail, judgment went against him: and in a suit for damages for false arrest the court held that the condition of that case was such that no such action could be maintained, which is entirely in accord with the contention of defendant in this case, and in no wise tends to support the claim made by the plaintiff. Neither does the case of Forster v. Orr (Or.) <a href="/citations/?q=21%20P.%20440" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="21 P. 440">21 Pac. 440</a>, cited by the plaintiff, seem to support his contention. In that case, action was brought against the defendant for the sum of $1,000 due for rent, and the plaintiff caused an order of arrest to issue in said action. The respondent, after being arrested, and consulting with counsel in regard to the matter, paid the appellant’s demand against him, on account of which he was arrested, and the disbursement in the proceedings against him accrued in said case and said arrest, and asked that he be released from custody, and that all further proceedings against him be discontinued. Whereupon, on order of the attorney for appellant, the respondent was released from custody, and all further proceedings against him were discontinued. A reply was filed to the allegations, and the issues tried. It was held in the case that the failure of the complainant to show that the writ of arrest had been vacated or 'set aside by the court in the action in which it was issued was a fatal defect, and that the complaint was insufficient to sustain a recovery had thereon. It was held, _ further, that an allegation in the answer to the effect that the plaintiff, after being arrested upon the writ of arrest, paid the defendant’s demand on account of which he was arrested, and the disbursements of the proceedings against him, accrued in the case in which the writ was issued, and that said arrest did <a id="p551" href="#p551" data-label="551" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*551</a>not aid the complainant in respect of such defect, but, on the contrary, showed that the arrest was acquiesced in by the defendant, and that the plaintiff did not deny in his reply the said allegation in the answer — all this showed that under the pleadings he had no cause of action. I fail to see wherein the case sustains the claim of counsel for the plaintiff, and, while it refers indirectly to the proposition of waiver, it does not go to the extent of sustaining the contention of plaintiff.</p>

It is further urged by counsel for the plaintiff in the court below that, inasmuch as an appeal has been taken in this case, it is a waiver, under the statute, to all objections to process, and is made so by statute, and that, where appeals are taken, the rule is entirely different from <a id="p552" href="#p552" data-label="552" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*552</a>that prevailing where a case is taken up on error.
