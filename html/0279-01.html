    <p id="b307-6" data-blocks='[["BL_307.7",307,[152,1066,1147,416]]]'>(1) That if the town council of Nome has power, by implication, to create a municipal court, the same implied power will enable it to confer authority upon the justice of the peace residing within its boundaries to try violations of its ordinances. The power, if it exists, is not limited to the creation of a new or municipal court; it may as well be exercised by conferring the necessary authority upon an existing court of competent jurisdiction, such as is the justice’s court.</p>
    <p id="b307-7" data-blocks='[["BL_307.8",307,[155,1494,1149,683]],["BL_308.1",308,[350,395,1142,93]]]'>(2) Even if the council has not the power to create a municipal court and confer criminal jurisdiction, still, if necessary to enable it to carry out the powers expressly granted to it to afford police and' other protection, it may, by ordinance, provide penalties which may be enforced under the grant of criminal jurisdiction in the justice’s court. This conclusion seems to .follow as well from the necessities of the situation as from the principles announced by the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of Ferris v-Higley. That was a case where the Legislature of the territory of Utah had conferred general chancery and common-law jurisdiction upon the probate courts established by the organic act. While denying the power of the Legislature <a id="p284" href="#p284" data-label="284" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*284</a>thus to change the very nature of a court established within the territory by Congress, the court nevertheless held:</p>
    <blockquote id="b308-4" data-blocks='[["BL_308.4",308,[348,521,1144,399]]]'>“There may be cases when that Legislature, conferring new rights ■or new remedies, or establishing • anomalous rules of proceedings within their legislative power, may direct in what court they shall be had. Nor are we called on to deny that the functions and powers of the probate courts may be more specifically defined by the territorial statutes within the limit of the general idea of the nature of probate courts, or that certain duties not strictly of that character may be imposed on them by that legislation.” Ferris v. Higley, <a href="/us/87/0375-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="20 Wall. 375" data-case-ids="3392453" data-case-paths="/us/87/0375-01">20 Wall. 375</a>, <a href="/us/87/0375-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="20 Wall. 375" data-case-ids="3392453" data-case-paths="/us/87/0375-01">22 L.

    <p id="b308-5" data-blocks='[["BL_308.5",308,[351,961,1144,200]]]'>(3) That the town council would not have any implied power to establish a court and confer jurisdiction in aid of its express powers if there is present a court with sufficient jurisdiction to perform that duty.</p>
    <p id="b308-6" data-blocks='[["BL_308.6",308,[351,1173,1144,463]]]'>(4) That the justice’s court now established in the town -of Nome has jurisdiction of all misdemeanors, and that no crime created by the common council by town ordinance can rise above that dignity. It only remains for the council to provide, by ordinance, for the trial of such matters in the justice’s court, and every requirement imposed by their express powers is met and complied with, and a court is provided with unquestioned jurisdiction given by the very power which created the council.</p>
    <p id="b308-7" data-blocks='[["BL_308.7",308,[346,1657,1150,518]]]'>(5) That the criminal and civil jurisdiction of justices of the peace cannot be interfered with or taken away by any ordinance of a town council. Since the judicial power in the territory is vested wholly in the district and justices’ courts, and since that express power covers the whole range of jurisdiction and is ample to meet every requirement imposed upon the judiciary within the district, it cannot be necessary for the court to sustain a doubtful and implied power in the common council to create a new court and divide that jurisdiction.</p>

      <a id="p285" href="#p285" data-label="285" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*285</a>Let us examine this new court for a moment in view of these general provisions of law guarantying the right of trial to citizens. Every person accused of crime before a justice is entitled to a trial by jury. Section 419, Cr. Code (Act March 3, 1899, c. 429, <a href="/citations/?q=30%20Stat.%201331" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="30 Stat. 1331">30 Stat. 1331</a>). All of his rights and the method of securing them are clearly pointed out by law. He is entitled to an appeal from the justice’s to the district court (section 441, Cr. Code), where his rights may be fully protected. But no such protection is given to the person tried in the municipal court. There is no provision for a jury trial, and no method of re-examination by appeal. Under such a jurisdiction, the municipal court would be an arbitrary tribunal, sitting without a jury, and from which no appeal would lie. It would have no relation to the courts already created by Congress, neither of which could exercise any supervisory control over it. While it would usurp the jurisdiction expressly conferred by the organic act upon the justice’s court, it would continue to be entirely independent from the control of any appellate tribunal. Such a court has no place in the judiciary existing under the organic laws of Alaska.</p>
    <blockquote id="b309-4" data-blocks='[["BL_309.4",309,[197,1541,1143,395]]]'>“The fact that the judges of these latter courts are appointed by the federal power, paid by that power, and that other officers of these courts are appointed and paid in like manner — strongly repels the idea that Congress, in conferring on these courts all the powers of courts of general jurisdiction, both civil and criminal, intended to leave to the territorial Legislature the power to practically evade or obstruct the exercise of those powers by conferring precisely the same jurisdiction on courts created and appointed by the territory."
