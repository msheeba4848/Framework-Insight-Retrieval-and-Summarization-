At that time the Golden Gate mining district was yet in existence under its organization by the miners prior to June 6, 1900. The clerk refused to receive or record his location, and informed him that he had 90 days, under the recently enacted Alaska Code, to record the notice. He did not record it, nor offer it for record with the recorder of the Golden Gate mining district, but waited until the court had created the Port Clarence and Kougarok commissioners’ districts and appointed recorders therein. On the 24th day of August, 1900, he recorded the notice in the Port Clarence commissioner’s district with the recorder appointed by the court. Having doubt about the boundaries of the commissioners’ districts, the notice was again recorded on the 28th of September, 1900, in the Kougarok district, which last district seems to have actually embraced the old Golden Gate mining district and the mining ground in question.</p>

He also described his claim as No. 3 on Lulu creek, a tributary of Iron creek, and gave the same courses and distances. Martin filed his notice with the recorder of the Golden Gate mining district on August 3d, and the same was duly recorded in the records of that district. Martin after-wards sold his claims to the defendant, the Good Enough Mining Company, which on August 7th filed and recorded an amended notice of location, giving a more particular description of the location by reference to natural objects.

    <p id="b273-8" data-blocks='[["BL_273.10",273,[170,1454,1146,299]]]'>It must be conceded that the notice is not a model one, yet it is in nearly the same form as that first made by Martin. It does contain the name of the locator, the date of the location, and attempts to describe the claim.

Of these familiar and general rules, one is that the first discovery is generally called^ and "known as the “discovery” claim, and that, when the same is within a gulch or on a stream, the claims are marked or <a id="p250" href="#p250" data-label="250" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*250</a>numbered from discovery claim up or down the gulch or stream.</p>
    <p id="b274-4" data-blocks='[["BL_274.4",274,[375,471,1146,1050]]]'>Another is that claims are frequently numbered or marked by reference to one which is so definitely established as to be used by all the miners along the same course as the initial claim, and is so used by other locators as a permanent monument. These matters are so widely known to miners and accepted by them, and are so commonly used and depended upon in making locations, that, if the court failed to recognize them and follow them, it would disorganize the entire mining system in this territory, and render titles void and insecure which have been acquired in good faith in full reliance upon this system. So well known and fixed are these methods of locating mining claims that it may be fairly said that on placer mining gulches and streams there exists a well recognized and established system of surveys having the discovery or first claim as the base line. To destroy that system by refusing to recognize it as a permanent monument, when in fact it is used as such, would be a calamity. In all proper cases this court will feel bound to so recognize such system, and support claims fairly described in accordance therewith.</p>

It is-described as claim “number three located on stream known as Lulu creek (a tributary of Iron creek) in the Golden Gate mining district, territory of Alaska, and particularly described as follows: Beginning at initial stake, at east end of claim No. 2; thence” following a plain line of permanent stakes around the premises to the point of beginning. It is apparent from this tie to the initial stake on the east end of No. 2 that the claim was a part of a general system of locating claims on Lulu creek, either above “discovery” or <a id="p251" href="#p251" data-label="251" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*251</a>No. i. The initial stake is situated on the east end of claim No. 2, and there is no evidence to show that claim No. 2 is-not a well-known natural object or permanent monument. There is no evidence to inform the court that the system beginning with “discovery” or No. 1 is not such a well-known system of surveys and locations that the mine in question cannot be easily and certainly located thereby. Nor is there any evidence to show that, with the notice before him, a miner could not, by beginning at the initial stake at the east end of No. 2, readily trace the boundaries from stake to stake along the courses from the point of beginning back to that point. Martin, who came upon the ground 31 days later than the senior locator, seems to have been able to find all of Marple’s stakes, for he set his own side by side with them.'</p>

Stakes driven into the-ground are in such cases the most certain means of identification. Such stakes were placed here, with a description of the premises by metes; and, to comply with the requirements of the statute as fal-as possible, the location of the lode is also indicated by stating its distance south of ‘Vaughan’s Little Jennie Mine,’ probably the best known and most easily defined object in the vicinity. We agree with the court below that the Little Jennie mine will be presumed to be a well-known natural object or permanent monument, until the contrary appears, where a location is described as in this notice, and is further described ‘as being 1,500 feet south from a well known quartz location, and there is nothing in the evidence to contradict such a description, distance, and direction.’ Hammer v.

The staking is also a sufficient marking of the boundaries, and the original location of Marple valid and effectual to reserve the property as <em>&amp; </em>mine.</p>

It is a sound principle of equity and good conscience that forfeitures are deemed odious, and courts will not resolve a doubt, either of law or fact, in favor of a forfeiture of property rights once fully and fairly vested. The intention of the law to forfeit the estate must be so clear as to leave the court no' room for other action, before it will enter the decree.
