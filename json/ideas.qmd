# Legal Case Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Analysis

This document demonstrates the use of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with the LLaMA model to perform summarization, question-answering, citation analysis, and comparison on legal cases.

## Setup

To begin, we load the necessary libraries and set up the models. We use FAISS for efficient retrieval and LLaMA for text generation. A dense retriever model, such as DistilBERT, is used to create embeddings of the legal case documents, which are then indexed by FAISS for fast retrieval.

## Building FAISS Index

To build the FAISS index, we create embeddings of specific fields (like case opinion texts) from each legal document. These embeddings represent the semantic content of each document, enabling the retrieval of similar cases based on a given query.

The FAISS index stores these embeddings in a structure that allows for fast similarity searches, which is crucial for real-time question-answering and summarization tasks.

## Helper Functions for RAG Tasks

### Summarization Function

This function retrieves the most relevant cases from the FAISS index for a given query and uses the LLaMA model to generate a summary based on the retrieved content. By combining retrieval with generation, we can create concise summaries of legal documents while including the most relevant details.

### Question-Answering (Q&A) Function

This function takes a legal question as input, retrieves the most relevant cases using the FAISS index, and generates an answer using LLaMA. The input is structured with the query and the retrieved context, allowing the model to provide precise answers by grounding them in relevant legal case details.

### Citation Analysis Function

For legal researchers interested in how specific statutes or cases have been referenced, the citation analysis function retrieves cases citing relevant statutes. The function uses FAISS to find documents with specific citations and then generates a contextual answer or summary of how these statutes were referenced, helping to map out legal precedents and influences.

### Document Comparison Function

The document comparison function allows for the analysis of similarities or differences between two legal cases. By retrieving relevant portions of each document, this function provides a basis for comparing legal reasoning, case outcomes, and other critical aspects, which is useful for legal analysis or study.

### Chunked Processing for Long Documents

Some legal cases contain lengthy opinions that may exceed model input limits. The chunked processing approach splits long texts into smaller sections, each of which is processed independently. After generating responses for each chunk, we can combine the outputs to create a complete response, summary, or analysis.

## Conclusion

Using FAISS for retrieval and LLaMA for generation, this document provides a structured approach to several common legal tasks:
- Summarization of legal cases
- Question answering based on case content
- Citation analysis for identifying related legal precedents
- Comparison of case opinions

This approach leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation to enhance legal research and analysis, enabling efficient extraction of insights from large sets of case data.
